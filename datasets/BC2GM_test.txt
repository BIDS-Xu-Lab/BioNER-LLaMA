To determine the role of elevated <mark>FAK</mark> expression in facilitating <mark>epidermal growth factor</mark> ( <mark>EGF</mark> ) - stimulated human adenocarcinoma ( A549 ) cell motility , antisense oligonucleotides were used to reduce <mark>FAK protein</mark> expression > 75 % . 
Evaluation of materials and technics in vascular surgery using 111 - Indium 
Functional importance of a properly folded surface loop covering the catalytic center . 
Hypoxia decreased the rate of spontaneous impulse initiation in SA nodal fibers by decreasing the slope of diastolic depolarization . 
Radiative corrections to pi l2 decays . 
The availability of a commercial program ( PCNONLIN ) is needed to carry out matrix handling calculations . 
The levels of <mark>TPAR1 mRNAs</mark> were dramatically down - regulated in regenerating rat liver when compared to normal adult liver . 
In the postoperative patient with tetralogy of Fallot with symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias , it is concluded that electrophysiologic study is useful in reproducing clinical episodes of VT and in selecting effective antiarrhythmic medication ; a small number of patients with ventricular premature complexes alone will have inducible sustained VT during electrophysiologic study ; prognosis of these patients may be improved by treatment that results in prevention of VT induction ; and in patients with right ventricular hypertension , VT is likely to be refractory to drug treatment . 
Hip fracture mortality and prospective payment system . 
Primary care programs for the indigent . 
In human myxoid liposarcoma , a chromosomal rearrangement leads to fusion of the growth - arresting and DNA - damage - inducible transcription factor <mark>CHOP</mark> ( <mark>GADD153</mark> ) to a peptide fragment encoded by the <mark>TLS gene</mark> . 
Categorisation of the different substructures within the sections allows them to be analysed and displayed separately . 
Authors present the anatomical variations of the course of the inferior mesenteric artery and its branches in 62 human fetus . 
This mechanism seems to be involved in <mark>VIP</mark> - induced <mark>PRL gene</mark> regulation . 
The only quantities which were significantly different between appendicitis and a normal appendix were sex , duration of symptoms , anorexia and vomiting . 
Signaling through <mark>mitogen - activated protein kinase</mark> and <mark>Rac</mark> / <mark>Rho</mark> does not duplicate the effects of activated <mark>Ras</mark> on skeletal myogenesis . 
The survival of patients with a short bowel , even if they need long - term parenteral nutrition , is good . 
Unlike these contaminant - responsive T cells , those that are truly specific for natural <mark>AChR epitopes</mark> appear less heterogeneous and therefore more suitable targets for selective immunotherapy . 
CONCLUSIONS : This initial experience indicates that there is short - to middle - term efficiency and safety when using GKS to treat MTLE . 
A Brassica cDNA clone encoding a bifunctional <mark>hydroxymethylpyrimidine kinase</mark> / <mark>thiamin - phosphate pyrophosphorylase</mark> involved in thiamin biosynthesis . 
The aims of this study were to examine whether the EORTC ( European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer ) QLQ - C30 core questionnaire alone could distinguish between two clinically different groups of patients and to design a module , which included relevant patient - defined gastric cancer - specific variables . 
The goal of our work was to determine hearing thresholds in patients with hearing impairment due to hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy ( HMSN I ) .
