Efficient targeting of protein antigen to the dendritic cell receptor <mark>DEC-205</mark> in the steady state leads to antigen presentation on <mark>major histocompatibility complex class I</mark> products and peripheral <mark>CD8</mark>+ T cell tolerance.
To identify endocytic receptors that allow dendritic cells (DCs) to capture and present antigens on <mark>major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I</mark> products in vivo, we evaluated <mark>DEC-205</mark>, which is abundant on DCs in lymphoid tissues.
<mark>Ovalbumin</mark> (<mark>OVA</mark>) protein, when chemically coupled to monoclonal alpha<mark>DEC-205</mark> antibody, was presented by <mark>CD11c</mark>+ lymph node DCs, but not by <mark>CD11c</mark>- cells, to <mark>OVA</mark>-specific, <mark>CD4</mark>+ and <mark>CD8</mark>+ T cells.
Receptor-mediated presentation was at least 400 times more efficient than unconjugated <mark>OVA</mark> and, for <mark>MHC class I</mark>, the DCs had to express <mark>transporter of antigenic peptides</mark> (<mark>TAP</mark>) transporters.
When alpha<mark>DEC-205</mark>:<mark>OVA</mark> was injected subcutaneously, <mark>OVA</mark> protein was identified over a 4-48 h period in DCs, primarily in the lymph nodes draining the injection site.
In vivo, the <mark>OVA</mark> protein was selectively presented by DCs to <mark>TCR</mark> transgenic <mark>CD8</mark>+ cells, again at least 400 times more effectively than soluble <mark>OVA</mark> and in a <mark>TAP</mark>-dependent fashion.
Targeting of alpha<mark>DEC-205</mark>:<mark>OVA</mark> to DCs in the steady state initially induced 4-7 cycles of T cell division, but the T cells were then deleted and the mice became specifically unresponsive to rechallenge with <mark>OVA</mark> in complete Freund's adjuvant.
In contrast, simultaneous delivery of a DC maturation stimulus via <mark>CD40</mark>, together with alpha<mark>DEC-205</mark>:<mark>OVA</mark>, induced strong immunity.
The <mark>CD8</mark>+ T cells responding in the presence of agonistic alpha<mark>CD40</mark> antibody produced large amounts of <mark>interleukin 2</mark> and <mark>interferon gamma</mark>, acquired cytolytic function in vivo, emigrated in large numbers to the lung, and responded vigorously to <mark>OVA</mark> rechallenge.
Therefore, <mark>DEC-205</mark> provides an efficient receptor-based mechanism for DCs to process proteins for <mark>MHC class I</mark> presentation in vivo, leading to tolerance in the steady state and immunity after DC maturation.
A major role for <mark>Scar</mark>/<mark>WAVE-1</mark> downstream of <mark>GPVI</mark> in platelets.
BACKGROUND: The <mark>small GTPase</mark> <mark>Rac1</mark> plays a critical role in lamellipodia assembly in platelets on matrix proteins in the absence or presence of <mark>G protein-coupled receptor</mark> (<mark>GPCR</mark>) agonists.
<mark>Rac</mark> mediates actin assembly via <mark>Scar</mark>/<mark>WAVE</mark>, a family of scaffolding proteins that direct <mark>actin</mark> reorganization by relaying signals from <mark>Rac</mark> to the <mark>Arp2/3</mark> complex.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of <mark>Scar</mark>/<mark>WAVE-1</mark> in mediating platelet activation and cytoskeletal reorganization.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using specific antibodies, we demonstrate that murine platelets, like human platelets, express <mark>Scar</mark>/<mark>WAVE-1</mark> and <mark>Scar</mark>/<mark>WAVE-2</mark>.
Lamellipodia formation in <mark>Scar</mark>/<mark>WAVE-1</mark>(-/-) platelets is markedly inhibited on immobilized <mark>collagen</mark>-related peptide (CRP) and on <mark>laminin</mark>, both of which signal through the <mark>collagen receptor</mark> <mark>GPVI</mark>.
In contrast, lamellipodia formation on <mark>collagen</mark>, which requires release of the <mark>GPCR</mark> agonists ADP and thromboxane A(2), is not altered.
Immobilized <mark>fibrinogen</mark> supports limited formation of lamellipodia in murine platelets, which is not altered in <mark>Scar</mark>/<mark>WAVE-1</mark>(-/-) platelets.
As with <mark>Rac1</mark>(-/-) platelets, <mark>Scar</mark>/<mark>WAVE-1</mark>(-/-) platelets exhibit a marked inhibition of aggregation in response to CRP, whereas the response to the <mark>GPCR</mark> agonist <mark>thrombin</mark> is not altered.
Platelet aggregation on immobilized <mark>collagen</mark> under shear, which is dependent on signaling by matrix and <mark>GPCR</mark> agonists, was unaltered in the absence of <mark>Scar</mark>/<mark>WAVE-1</mark>.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a major role for <mark>Scar</mark>/<mark>WAVE-1</mark> in mediating platelet cytoskeletal reorganization and aggregate formation downstream of activation by <mark>GPVI</mark> but not by <mark>GPCR</mark> agonists.
DNA damage activates the SAC in an <mark>ATM</mark>/<mark>ATR</mark>-dependent manner, independently of the kinetochore.
The DNA damage checkpoint and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) are two important regulatory mechanisms that respond to different lesions.
The DNA damage checkpoint detects DNA damage, initiates <mark>protein kinase</mark> cascades, and inhibits the cell cycle.
The SAC relies on kinetochore-dependent assembly of protein complexes to inhibit mitosis when chromosomes are detached from the spindle.
The two checkpoints are thought to function independently.
Here we show that yeast cells lacking the DNA damage checkpoint arrest prior to anaphase in response to low doses of the DNA damaging agent methyl methane sulfonate (MMS).
The arrest requires the <mark>SAC proteins</mark> <mark>Mad1</mark>, <mark>Mad2</mark>, <mark>Mad3</mark>, <mark>Bub1</mark>, and <mark>Bub3</mark> and works through <mark>Cdc20</mark> and <mark>Pds1</mark> but unlike the normal SAC, does not require a functional kinetochore.
<mark>Mec1</mark> (<mark>ATR</mark>) and <mark>Tel1</mark> (<mark>ATM</mark>) are also required, independently of <mark>Chk1</mark> and <mark>Rad53</mark>, suggesting that <mark>Mec1</mark> and <mark>Tel1</mark> inhibit anaphase in response to DNA damage by utilizing <mark>SAC proteins</mark>.
Our results demonstrate cross-talk between the two checkpoints and suggest that assembling inhibitory complexes of <mark>SAC proteins</mark> at unattached kinetochores is not obligatory for their inhibitory activity.
Furthermore, our results suggest that there are novel, important targets of <mark>ATM</mark> and <mark>ATR</mark> for cell cycle regulation.
A point mutation in <mark>translation initiation factor 2B</mark> leads to a continuous hyper stress state in oligodendroglial-derived cells.
BACKGROUND: Mutations in <mark>eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B</mark> (<mark>eIF2B</mark>) cause Childhood Ataxia with CNS Hypomyelination (CACH), also known as Vanishing White Matter disease (VWM).
The disease is manifested by loss of brain myelin upon physiological stress.
In a previous study, we showed that fibroblasts isolated from CACH/VWM patients are hypersensitive to pharmacologically-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.
Since brain cells from affected individuals are not available for research, we wished to assess the effect of <mark>eIF2B</mark> mutation on oligodendroglial-derived cells.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A rat oligodendroglial-derived cell line was used for a stable knock-down of <mark>eIF2B5</mark> followed by stable expression of mutated <mark>eIF2B5</mark>(R195H) cDNA.
In response to a pharmacological ER-stress agent, <mark>eIF2B5</mark>(R195H) expressing cells exhibited heightened ER-stress response demonstrated by hyper induction of <mark>ATF4</mark>, <mark>GADD34</mark>, <mark>Bip</mark>, <mark>PDIA1</mark>, <mark>PDIA3</mark>, <mark>PDIA4</mark> and <mark>PDIA6</mark> proteins.
Moreover, even in the absence of a pharmacological stress agent, <mark>eIF2B5</mark>(R195H)-expressing cells exhibited high basal levels of <mark>ATF4</mark>, <mark>GADD34</mark> and ER-associated <mark>Bip</mark>, <mark>PDIA1</mark> and <mark>PDIA3</mark>.
SIGNIFICANCE: The data provide evidence that oligodendroglial-derived cells expressing a mutated <mark>eIF2B</mark> constantly use their stress response mechanism as an adaptation mean in order to survive.
The current study is the first to demonstrate the effects of <mark>eIF2B5</mark> mutation on ER homeostasis in oligodendroglial-derived cells.
<mark>Thymosin beta4</mark> mediated <mark>PKC</mark> activation is essential to initiate the embryonic coronary developmental program and epicardial progenitor cell activation in adult mice in vivo.
Hypoxic heart disease is a predominant cause of disability and death worldwide.
Since adult mammalian hearts are incapable of regeneration after hypoxia, attempts to modify this deficiency are critical.
As demonstrated in zebrafish, recall of the embryonic developmental program may be the key to success.
Because <mark>thymosin beta4</mark> (<mark>TB4</mark>) is beneficial for myocardial cell survival and essential for coronary development in embryos, we hypothesized that it reactivates the embryonic developmental program and initiates epicardial progenitor mobilization in adult mammals.
We found that <mark>TB4</mark> stimulates capillary-like tube formation of adult coronary endothelial cells and increases embryonic endothelial cell migration and proliferation in vitro.
The increase of <mark>blood vessel/epicardial substance</mark> (<mark>Bves</mark>) expressing cells accompanied by elevated <mark>VEGF</mark>, <mark>Flk-1</mark>, <mark>TGF-beta</mark>, <mark>Fgfr-2</mark>, <mark>Fgfr-4</mark>, <mark>Fgf-17</mark> and <mark>beta-Catenin</mark> expression and increase of <mark>Tbx-18</mark> and <mark>Wt-1</mark> positive myocardial progenitors suggested organ-wide recall of the embryonic program in the adult epicardium.
<mark>TB4</mark> also positively regulated the expression and phosphorylation of <mark>myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate</mark> (<mark>Marcks</mark>), a direct substrate and indicator of <mark>protein kinase C</mark> (<mark>PKC</mark>) activity in vitro and in vivo.
<mark>PKC</mark> inhibition significantly reduced <mark>TB4</mark> initiated epicardial thickening, capillary growth and the number of myocardial progenitors.
Our results demonstrate that <mark>TB4</mark> is the first known molecule capable of organ-wide activation of the embryonic coronary developmental program in the adult mammalian heart after systemic administration and that <mark>PKC</mark> plays a significant role in the process.
In vivo <mark>Angiotensin II AT1 receptor</mark> blockade selectively inhibits LPS-induced innate immune response and <mark>ACTH</mark> release in rat pituitary gland.
Systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration induces an innate immune response and stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
We studied <mark>Angiotensin II AT(1) receptor</mark> participation in the LPS effects with focus on the pituitary gland.
LPS (50 microg/kg, i.p.) enhanced, 3h after administration, gene expression of pituitary <mark>CD14</mark> and that of <mark>Angiotensin II AT(1A) receptors</mark> in pituitary and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN); stimulated <mark>ACTH</mark> and corticosterone release; decreased pituitary <mark>CRF(1) receptor</mark> mRNA and increased all plasma and pituitary pro-inflammatory factors studied.
The <mark>AT(1) receptor</mark> blocker (ARB) candesartan (1mg/kg/day, s.c. daily for 3 days before LPS) blocked pituitary and PVN <mark>AT(1) receptors</mark>, inhibited LPS-induced <mark>ACTH</mark> but not corticosterone secretion and decreased LPS-induced release of <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>, <mark>IL-1beta</mark> and <mark>IL-6</mark> to the circulation.
The ARB reduced LPS-induced pituitary gene expression of <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>LIF</mark>, <mark>iNOS</mark>, <mark>COX-2</mark> and <mark>IkappaB-alpha</mark>; and prevented LPS-induced increase of <mark>nNOS</mark>/<mark>eNOS</mark> activity.
The ARB did not affect LPS-induced <mark>TNF-alpha</mark> and <mark>IL-1beta</mark> gene expression, <mark>IL-6</mark> or <mark>IL-1beta</mark> protein content or LPS-induced decrease of <mark>CRF(1) receptors</mark>.
When administered alone, the ARB increased basal plasma corticosterone levels and basal PGE(2) mRNA in pituitary.
Our results demonstrate that the pituitary gland is a target for systemically administered LPS.
<mark>AT(1) receptor</mark> activity is necessary for the complete pituitary response to LPS and is limited to specific pro-inflammatory pathways.
There is a complementary and complex influence of the PVN and circulating <mark>cytokines</mark> on the initial pituitary response to LPS.
Our findings support the proposal that ARBs may be considered for the treatment of inflammatory conditions.
Caenorhabditis elegans <mark>protein arginine methyltransferase</mark> <mark>PRMT-5</mark> negatively regulates DNA damage-induced apoptosis.
Arginine methylation of <mark>histone</mark> and non-<mark>histone</mark> proteins is involved in transcription regulation and many other cellular processes.
Nevertheless, whether such protein modification plays a regulatory role during apoptosis remains largely unknown.
Here we report that the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of mammalian <mark>type II arginine methyltransferase</mark> <mark>PRMT5</mark> negatively regulates DNA damage-induced apoptosis.
We show that inactivation of C. elegans <mark>prmt-5</mark> leads to excessive apoptosis in germline following ionizing irradiation, which is due to a <mark>CEP-1</mark>/<mark>p53</mark>-dependent up-regulation of the cell death initiator <mark>EGL-1</mark>.
Moreover, we provide evidence that <mark>CBP-1</mark>, the worm ortholog of human <mark>p300</mark>/<mark>CBP</mark>, functions as a cofactor of <mark>CEP-1</mark>.
<mark>PRMT-5</mark> forms a complex with both <mark>CEP-1</mark> and <mark>CBP-1</mark> and can methylate the latter.
Importantly, down-regulation of <mark>cbp-1</mark> significantly suppresses DNA damage-induced <mark>egl-1</mark> expression and apoptosis in <mark>prmt-5</mark> mutant worms.
These findings suggest that <mark>PRMT-5</mark> likely represses <mark>CEP-1</mark> transcriptional activity through <mark>CBP-1</mark>, which represents a novel regulatory mechanism of <mark>p53</mark>-dependent apoptosis.
Identification of novel gene amplifications in breast cancer and coexistence of gene amplification with an activating mutation of <mark>PIK3CA</mark>.
To identify genetic events that characterize cancer progression, we conducted a comprehensive genetic evaluation of 161 primary breast tumors.
Similar to the "mountain-and-hill" view of mutations, gene amplification also shows high- and low-frequency alterations in breast cancers.
The frequently amplified genes include the well-known <mark>oncogenes</mark> <mark>ERBB2</mark>, <mark>FGFR1</mark>, <mark>MYC</mark>, <mark>CCND1</mark>, and <mark>PIK3CA</mark>, whereas other known <mark>oncogenes</mark> that are amplified, although less frequently, include <mark>CCND2</mark>, <mark>EGFR</mark>, <mark>FGFR2</mark>, and <mark>NOTCH3</mark>.
More importantly, by honing in on minimally amplified regions containing three or fewer genes, we identified six new amplified genes: <mark>POLD3</mark>, <mark>IRAK4</mark>, <mark>IRX2</mark>, <mark>TBL1XR1</mark>, <mark>ASPH</mark>, and <mark>BRD4</mark>.
We found that both the <mark>IRX2</mark> and <mark>TBL1XR1</mark> proteins showed higher expression in the malignant cell lines MCF10CA1h and MCF10CA1a than in their precursor, MCF10A, a normal immortalized mammary epithelial cell line.
To study oncogenic roles of <mark>TBL1XR1</mark>, we performed knockdown experiments using a short hairpin RNA approach and found that depletion of <mark>TBL1XR1</mark> in MCF10CA1h cells resulted in reduction of cell migration and invasion as well as suppression of tumorigenesis in mouse xenografts.
Intriguingly, our mutation analysis showed the presence of activation mutations in the <mark>PIK3CA</mark> gene in a subset of tumors that also had DNA copy number increases in the <mark>PIK3CA</mark> locus, suggesting an additive effect of coexisting activating amino acid substitution and dosage increase from amplification.
Our gene amplification and somatic mutation analysis of breast primary tumors provides a coherent picture of genetic events, both corroborating and novel, offering insight into the genetic underpinnings of breast cancer progression.
The <mark>tetraspanin</mark> <mark>KAI1</mark>/<mark>CD82</mark> is expressed by late-lineage oligodendrocyte precursors and may function to restrict precursor migration and promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination.
In the adult mammalian brain, oligodendrocyte progenitors can differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes during remyelination.
Mechanisms that regulate migration and differentiation of progenitors are of great importance in understanding normal development and demyelinating/remyelinating conditions.
In a microarray analysis comparing adult and neonatal O4-positive (+) cells, we found that the <mark>tetraspanin</mark> <mark>KAI1</mark>/<mark>CD82</mark> is far more highly expressed in adult O4(+) cells than in neonatal O4(+) cells (Lin et al., 2009).
<mark>CD82</mark> is a metastasis suppressor, and its expression is often downregulated or lost in the advanced stages of metastatic cancer.
We hypothesized that <mark>CD82</mark> could be a factor that restricts migration and promotes differentiation of maturing oligodendrocytes.
Western blot analysis of isolated adult O4(+) cells confirms the elevated levels of <mark>CD82</mark>, which continues to be expressed as these become O1(+) in vitro.
In the adult rat white matter, <mark>CD82</mark> is coexpressed with <mark>CC1</mark> and <mark>olig2</mark> but not with <mark>NG2</mark> or <mark>GFAP</mark>.
Immature cells of the neonatal forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ) infected in vivo with a retrovirus that constitutively expresses <mark>CD82</mark> do not remain immature but differentiate into either <mark>CC1</mark>(+) and <mark>MBP</mark>(+) myelinating oligodendrocytes in the white matter or <mark>zebrinII</mark>(+) astrocytes in the cortex.
Their migration from the SVZ is severely restricted.
In contrast, downregulation of <mark>CD82</mark> in SVZ cells in vivo, using retroviral-expressed short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), prevents their differentiation into myelinating oligodendrocytes.
shRNA-expressing cells remained <mark>PDGF receptor alpha</mark> positive, <mark>olig2</mark>(+), or <mark>NG2</mark>(+) or became <mark>CC1</mark>(+) nonmyelinating oligodendrocytes or <mark>GFAP</mark>(+) astrocytes.
<mark>CD82</mark> thus appears to be a critical molecule in the regulation of oligodendrocyte progenitor migration and myelination.
Zebrafish <mark>chordin-like</mark> and <mark>chordin</mark> are functionally redundant in regulating patterning of the dorsoventral axis.
<mark>Chordin</mark> is the prototype of a group of <mark>cysteine-rich domain-containing proteins</mark> that bind and modulate signaling of various <mark>TGFbeta</mark>-like ligands.
<mark>Chordin-like 1 and 2</mark> (<mark>CHL1 and 2</mark>) are two members of this group that have been described in human, mouse, and chick.
However, in vivo roles for <mark>CHL1 and 2</mark> in early development are unknown due to lack of loss-of-function analysis.
Here we identify and characterize zebrafish, Danio rerio, <mark>CHL</mark> (<mark>Chl</mark>).
The <mark>chl</mark> gene is on a region of chromosome 21 syntenic with the area of murine chromosome 7 bearing the <mark>CHL2</mark> gene.
Inability to identify a separate zebrafish gene corresponding to the mammalian <mark>CHL1</mark> gene suggests that <mark>Chl</mark> may serve roles in zebrafish distributed between <mark>CHL1</mark> and <mark>CHL2</mark> in other species.
<mark>Chl</mark> is a maternal factor that is also zygotically expressed later in development and has spatiotemporal expression patterns that differ from but overlap those of zebrafish <mark>chordin</mark> (<mark>Chd</mark>), suggesting differences but also possible overlap in developmental roles of the two proteins.
<mark>Chl</mark>, like <mark>Chd</mark>, dorsalizes embryos upon overexpression and is cleaved by <mark>BMP1</mark>, which antagonizes this activity.
Loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that <mark>Chl</mark> serves as a <mark>BMP</mark> antagonist with functions that overlap and are redundant with those of <mark>Chd</mark> in forming the dorsoventral axis.
Antitumor and antiangiogenic effect of the dual <mark>EGFR</mark> and <mark>HER-2</mark> <mark>tyrosine kinase</mark> inhibitor lapatinib in a lung cancer model.
BACKGROUND: There is strong evidence demonstrating that activation of <mark>epidermal growth factor receptors</mark> (<mark>EGFRs</mark>) leads to tumor growth, progression, invasion and metastasis.
Erlotinib and gefitinib, two <mark>EGFR</mark>-targeted agents, have been shown to be relevant drugs for lung cancer treatment.
Recent studies demonstrate that lapatinib, a dual <mark>tyrosine kinase</mark> inhibitor of <mark>EGFR</mark> and <mark>HER-2</mark> receptors, is clinically effective against <mark>HER-2</mark>-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.
In this report, we investigated the activity of lapatinib against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: We selected the lung cancer cell line A549, which harbors genomic amplification of <mark>EGFR</mark> and <mark>HER-2</mark>.
Proliferation, cell cycle analysis, clonogenic assays, and signaling cascade analyses (by western blot) were performed in vitro.
In vivo experiments with A549 cells xenotransplanted into nude mice treated with lapatinib (with or without radiotherapy) were also carried out.
RESULTS: Lapatinib dramatically reduced cell proliferation (P < 0.0001), DNA synthesis (P < 0.006), and colony formation capacity (P < 0.0001) in A549 cells in vitro.
Furthermore, lapatinib induced G1 cell cycle arrest (P < 0.0001) and apoptotic cell death (P < 0.0006) and reduced <mark>cyclin A and B1</mark> levels, which are regulators of S and G2/M cell cycle stages, respectively.
Stimulation of apoptosis in lapatinib-treated A549 cells was correlated with increased cleaved <mark>PARP</mark>, active <mark>caspase-3</mark>, and proapoptotic <mark>Bak-1</mark> levels, and reduction in the antiapoptotic <mark>IAP-2</mark> and <mark>Bcl-xL</mark> protein levels.
We also demonstrate that lapatinib altered <mark>EGFR</mark>/<mark>HER-2</mark> signaling pathways reducing p-<mark>EGFR</mark>, p-<mark>HER-2</mark>, p-<mark>ERK1/2</mark>, p-<mark>AKT</ma<mark>AKT,</mark> <mark>c-Myc</mark> and <mark>PCNA</mark> levels.
In vivo experiments revealed that A549 tumor-bearing mice treated with lapatinib had significantly less active tumors (as assessed by PET analysis) (P < 0.04) and smaller in size than controls.
In addition, tumors from lapatinib-treated mice showed a dramatic reduction in angiogenesis (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Overall, these data suggest that lapatinib may be a clinically useful agent for the treatment of lung cancer.
Arecoline induces HA22T/VGH hepatoma cells to undergo anoikis - involvement of <mark>STAT3</mark> and <mark>RhoA</mark> activation.
BACKGROUND: Our previous study showed that, in basal cell carcinoma cells, arecoline reduces levels of the tumor cell survival factor <mark>interleukin-6</mark> (<mark>IL-6</mark>), increases levels of tumor suppressor factor <mark>p53</mark>, and elicits cell cycle arrest, followed by apoptosis.
In preliminarily studies, we observed that arecoline induces detachment of the human-derived hepatoma cell line HA22T/VGH from the extracellular matrix.
In the present study, we explored the fate of the detached HA22T/VGH cells and investigated the underlying mechanism.
METHODS: HA22T/VGH cells or primary cultured rat hepatocytes were treated with arecoline, then changes in morphology, viability, apoptosis, and the expression of surface <mark>beta1-integrin</mark>, <mark>apoptosis-related proteins</mark>, and <mark>IL-6</mark> were examined.
Furthermore, activation of the <mark>signal transducer and activator of transcription 3</mark> (<mark>STAT3</mark>) pathway and the <mark>RhoA</mark>/<mark>Rock</mark> signaling pathway, including <mark>p190RhoGAP</mark> and <mark>Src homology-2 domain-containing phosphatase</mark> <mark>SHP2</mark>, was examined.
RESULTS: A low concentration of arecoline (&lt;or= 100 microg/ml) caused cytoskeletal changes in HA22T/VGH cells, but not hepatocytes, and this was accompanied by decreased <mark>beta1-integrin</mark> expression and followed by apoptosis, indicating that HA22T/VGH cells undergo anoikis after arecoline treatment.
<mark>IL-6</mark> expression and phosphorylation of <mark>STAT3</mark>, which provides protection against anoikis, were inhibited and levels of downstream signaling proteins, including <mark>Bcl-XL</mark> and <mark>Bcl-2</mark>, were decreased, while <mark>Bax</mark> expression, mitochondrial <mark>cytochrome c</mark> release, and <mark>caspase-3</mark> activity were increased.
In addition, phosphorylation/activation of <mark>p190RhoGAP</mark>, a <mark>RhoA</mark> inhibitor, and of its upstream regulator, <mark>SHP2</mark>, was inhibited by arecoline treatment, while <mark>Rho</mark>/<mark>Rock</mark> activation was increased.
Addition of the <mark>RhoA</mark> inhibitor attenuated the effects of arecoline.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that arecoline induces anoikis of HA22T/VGH cells involving inhibition of <mark>STAT3</mark> and increased <mark>RhoA</mark>/<mark>Rock</mark> activation and that the <mark>STAT3</mark> and <mark>RhoA</mark>/<mark>Rock</mark> signaling pathways are connected.
Blocking of <mark>ERK1</mark> and <mark>ERK2</mark> sensitizes human mesothelioma cells to doxorubicin.
BACKGROUND: Malignant mesotheliomas (MM) have a poor prognosis, largely because of their chemoresistance to anti-cancer drugs such as doxorubicin (Dox).
Here we show using human MM lines that Dox activates <mark>extracellular signal-regulated kinases</mark> (<mark>ERK1 and 2</mark>), causally linked to increased expression of ABC transporter genes, decreased accumulation of Dox, and enhanced MM growth.
Using the <mark>MEK1/2</mark> inhibitor, U0126 and stably transfected sh<mark>ERK1</mark> and sh<mark>ERK2</mark> MM cell lines, we show that inhibition of both <mark>ERK1 and 2</mark> sensitizes MM cells to Dox.
RESULTS: U0126 significantly modulated endogenous expression of several important drug resistance (<mark>BCL2</mark>, <mark>ABCB1</mark>, <mark>ABCC3</mark>), prosurvival (<mark>BCL2</mark>), DNA repair (<mark>BRCA1</mark>, <mark>BRCA2</mark>), <mark>hormone receptor</mark> (<mark>AR</mark>, <mark>ESR2</mark>, <mark>PPARgamma</mark>) and drug metabolism (<mark>CYP3A4</mark>) genes newly identified in MM cells.
In comparison to shControl lines, MM cell lines stably transfected with sh<mark>ERK1</mark> or sh<mark>ERK2</mark> exhibited significant increases in intracellular accumulation of Dox and decreases in cell viability.
Affymetrix microarray analysis on stable sh<mark>ERK1</mark> and sh<mark>ERK2</mark> MM lines showed more than 2-fold inhibition (p &lt;= 0.05) of expression of <mark>ATP binding cassette</mark> genes (<mark>ABCG1</mark>, <mark>ABCA5</mark>, <mark>ABCA2</mark>, <mark>MDR/TAP</mark>, <mark>ABCA1</mark>, <mark>ABCA8</mark>, <mark>ABCC2</mark>) in comparison to shControl lines.
Moreover, injection of human MM lines into SCID mice showed that stable sh<mark>ERK1</mark> or sh<mark>ERK2</mark> lines had significantly slower tumor growth rates in comparison to shControl lines after Dox treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that blocking <mark>ERK1 and 2</mark>, which play critical roles in multi-drug resistance and survival, may be beneficial in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment of MMs and other tumors.
<mark>T-bet</mark>-mediated differentiation of the activated <mark>CD8</mark>+ T cell.
The <mark>T-box transcription factor</mark>, <mark>T-bet</mark> promotes the differentiation of short-lived effector <mark>CD8</mark>(+) T cells at the expense of central memory cells.
How <mark>T-bet</mark> mediates these effects, and whether they are directly caused by <mark>T-bet</mark> alone are unknown, because expression of <mark>T-bet</mark> requires stimulation of the T cell by inflammatory and growth cytokines, which may have <mark>T-bet</mark>-independent functions involving T-cell differentiation.
We developed an in vitro system of ectopic <mark>T-bet</mark> expression that avoids the effects of inflammatory cytokines to determine which aspects of the <mark>T-bet</mark> phenotype may be accounted for by <mark>T-bet</mark> alone.
Ectopic <mark>T-bet</mark> expression by OT-I <mark>CD8</mark>(+) T cells stimulated by the <mark>H2-Kb</mark> (<mark>SIINFEKL</mark>) complex and cultured with 2 ng/mL IL-2 induced a coordinated change in gene expression leading to down-regulation of <mark>CD127</mark> and <mark>SOCS-1</mark> and up-regulation of <mark>CD122</mark> and <mark>IL-15</<mark>IL-15 receptor α</mark>, switching the cellular survival cytokine from <mark>IL-7</mark> to <mark>IL-15</mark>.
<mark>T-bet</mark> expression and 2 ng/mL IL-2 also led to a capacity for <mark>IFN-γ</mark> and <mark>Fas ligand</mark> expression, confirming a role in eliciting these effector functions.
Finally, ectopic <mark>T-bet</mark> promoted the expression of <mark>B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1</mark> by OT-I cells in the presence of 20 ng/mL IL-2, providing a mechanism for the role of <mark>T-bet</mark> in driving terminal differentiation in concert with a high level of <mark>IL-2 receptor</mark> signalling.
<mark>TGF-β</mark> signaling is required for maintenance of retinal ganglion cell differentiation and survival.
PURPOSE: To determine the role of <mark>TGF-β1</mark> in the maintenance of retinal ganglion cell line (RGC-5) differentiation and integrity.
METHODS: RGC-5 cells were differentiated in media conditioned by human non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells (HNPE) for 4 days before treatment with <mark>TGF-β1</mark> for 24 h. Cells were examined for morphological changes and harvested for western blot and real-time PCR analysis.
For study of apoptosis, differentiated RGC-5 cells were grown in serum-free medium for 24 h in the presence or absence of <mark>TGF-β1</mark> and collected for <mark>Annexin V</mark>/Propidium iodide FACs analysis.
The role of <mark>MAPK</mark> pathways in <mark>TGF-β1</mark>-dependent signaling was determined by treatment with specific inhibitors of <mark>ERK</mark>, <mark>JNK</mark> and <mark>p38</mark>.
RESULTS: Differentiation of RGC-5 cells in HNPE-conditioned media (CM) increased the neural cell markers, <mark>Brn-3c</mark>, <mark>NF-160</mark>, <mark>Thy1.2</mark>, <mark>Tau</mark> and <mark>PGP9.5</mark>.
Treatment with <mark>TGF-β1</mark> significantly increased the length of neurites extended by differentiated RGC-5s, concomitant with increased expression of <mark>NF-160</mark> and <mark>PGP9.5</mark>, but not <mark>Brn-3c</mark>, <mark>Thy1.2</mark> or <mark>Tau</mark>.
<mark>TGF-β1</mark> also decreased RGC-5 cell apoptosis in serum-free medium.
<mark>p38</mark> phosphorylation, but not <mark>smad2/3</mark>, <mark>JNK</mark> or <mark>ERK</mark> phosphorylation, was increased in <mark>TGF-β1</mark> treated cells.
Specific inhibition of <mark>p38</mark> signaling reversed <mark>TGF-β1</mark> induced neurite growth.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the induction of RGC-5 cell differentiation by HNPE-derived CM and illustrate a role for <mark>TGF-β1</mark> in maintaining RGC-5 cell survival and promoting neurite outgrowth through <mark>p38 MAPK</mark>.
Aberrant expression of genes necessary for neuronal development and <mark>Notch</mark> signaling in an epileptic <mark>mind bomb</mark> zebrafish.
Mutation within an <mark>ubiquitin E3 ligase</mark> gene can lead to a failure in <mark>Notch</mark> signaling, excessive neurons, and depletion of neural progenitor cells in <mark>mind bomb</mark> mutants.
Using <mark>mib</mark>(hi904) zebrafish, we reported seizures and a down-regulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling pathway genes.
A transcriptome analysis also identified differential expression pattern of genes related to <mark>Notch</mark> signaling and neurodevelopment.
Here, we selected nine of these genes (<mark>her4.2</mark>, <mark>hes5</mark>, <mark>bhlhb5</mark>, <mark>hoxa5a</mark>, <mark>hoxb5b</mark>, <mark>dmbx1a</mark>, <mark>dbx1a</mark>, <mark>nxph1</mark>, and <mark>plxnd1</mark>) and performed a more thorough analysis of expression using conventional polymerase chain reaction, real-time polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization.
Transgenic reporter fish (<mark>Gfap</mark>:GFP and <mark>Dlx5a-6a</mark>:GFP) were used to assess early brain morphology in vivo.
Down-regulation of many of these genes was prominent throughout key structures of the developing <mark>mib</mark>(hi904) zebrafish brain including, but not limited to, the pallium, ventral thalamus, and optic tectum.
Brain expression of <mark>Dlx5a-6a</mark> and <mark>Gfap</mark> was also reduced.
In conclusion, these expression studies indicate a general down-regulation of <mark>Notch</mark> signaling genes necessary for proper brain development and suggest that these mutant fish could provide valuable insights into neurological conditions, such as Angelman syndrome, associated with <mark>ubiquitin E3 ligase</mark> mutation.
Atlas of <mark>Wnt</mark> and <mark>R-spondin</mark> gene expression in the developing male mouse lower urogenital tract.
Prostate development is influenced by <mark>β-catenin</mark> signaling, but it is unclear which <mark>β-catenin</mark> activators are involved, where they are synthesized, and whether their mRNA abundance is influenced by androgens.
We identified <mark>WNT</mark>/<mark>β-catenin</mark>-responsive β-galactosidase activity in the lower urogenital tract (LUT) of transgenic reporter mice, but β-galactosidase activity differed among the four mouse strains we examined.
We used in situ hybridization to compare patterns of <mark>Wnts</mark>, <mark>r-spondins</mark> (<mark>Rspo</m<mark>Rspos</mark>, co-activators of <mark>β-catenin</mark> signaling), <mark>β-catenin</mark>-responsive mRNAs, and an androgen receptor-responsive mRNA in wild type fetal male, fetal female, and neonatal male LUT.
Most <mark>Wnt</mark> and <mark>Rspo</mark> mRNAs were present in LUT during prostate development.
Sexually dimorphic expression patterns were observed for <mark>WNT</mark>/<mark>β-catenin</mark>-responsive genes, and for <mark>Wnt2b</mark>, <mark>Wnt4</mark>, <mark>Wnt7a</mark>, <mark>Wnt9b</mark>, <mark>Wnt10b</mark>, <mark>Wnt11</mark>, <mark>Wnt16</mark>, and <mark>Rspo3</mark> mRNAs.
These results reveal sexual differences in <mark>WNT</mark>/<mark>β-catenin</mark> signaling in fetal LUT, supporting the idea that this pathway may be directly or indirectly responsive to androgens during prostate ductal development.
Recombinant <mark>Brugia malayi pepsin inhibitor</mark> (r<mark>Bm33</mark>) induced monocyte function and absence of apoptotic cell death: an in vitro study.
The effect of recombinant <mark>Brugia malayi pepsin inhibitor</mark> (r<mark>Bm33</mark>) on human monocytes/macrophages has been examined using THP-1 cells.
THP-1 cells stimulated with r<mark>Bm33</mark> showed enhanced levels of expression of pro-inflammatory <mark>cytokines</mark> (<mark>IL-1beta</mark>, <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>) and diminished levels of <mark>IL-12</mark>, <mark>iNOS</mark> and anti-inflammatory <mark>cytokine</mark> (<mark>IL-10</mark>) expression suggesting the predominant features of Th1 response.
Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) treated THP-1 cells stimulated with r<mark>Bm33</mark> and subsequent incubation with GFP expressing Escherichia coli (E. coli) for 2 h enhanced the uptake of E. coli.
Nitric oxide (NO) levels measured in the supernatants of these cultures did not show significant changes.
Apoptotic studies with Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from normal individuals stimulated with r<mark>Bm33</mark> did not induce apoptosis of monocytes or lymphocytes.
These observations suggest that r<mark>Bm33</mark> stimulates macrophages to induce Th1 response and does not promote apoptosis.
Knockdown of <mark>cathepsin B</mark> and <mark>uPAR</mark> inhibits <mark>CD151</mark> and <mark>α3β1 integrin</mark>-mediated cell adhesion and invasion in glioma.
Glioma is a highly complex brain tumor characterized by the dysregulation of proteins and genes that leads to tumor metastasis.
<mark>Cathepsin B</mark> and <mark>uPAR</mark> are overexpressed in gliomas and they are postulated to play central roles in glioma metastasis.
In this study, efficient downregulation of <mark>cathepsin B</mark> and <mark>uPAR</mark> by siRNA treatments significantly reduced glioma cell adhesion to <mark>laminin</mark> as compared to <mark>vitronectin</mark>, <mark>fibronectin</mark>, or <mark>collagen I</mark> in U251 and 4910 glioma cell lines.
Brain glioma tissue array analysis showed high expression of <mark>CD151</mark> in clinical samples when compared with normal brain tissue.
<mark>Cathepsin B</mark> and <mark>uPAR</mark> siRNA treatment led to the downregulation of <mark>CD151</mark> and <mark>laminin<mark>laminin-binding integri<mark>integrins α3 and β1</mark>.
Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that downregulation of <mark>cathepsin B</mark> and <mark>uPAR</mark> decreased the interaction of <mark>CD151</mark> with <mark>uPAR</mark> <mark>cathepsin B</mark>, and <mark>α3β1 integrin</mark>.
Studies on the downstream signaling cascade of <mark>uPAR</mark>/<mark>CD151</mark>/<mark>α3β1 integrin</mark> have shown that phosphorylation of <mark>FAK</mark>, <mark>SRC</mark>, <mark>paxillin</mark>, and expression of adaptor <mark>cytoskeletal proteins</mark> <mark>talin</mark> and <mark>vinculin</mark> were reduced with knockdown of <mark>cathepsin B</mark>, <mark>uPAR</mark>, and <mark>CD151</mark>.
Treatment with the bicistronic construct reduced interactions between <mark>uPAR</mark> and <mark>CD151</mark> as well as lowering <mark>α3β1 integrin</mark>, <mark>talin</mark>, and <mark>vinculin</mark> expression levels in pre-established glioma tumors of nude mice.
In conclusion, our results show that downregulation of <mark>cathepsin B</mark> and <mark>uPAR</mark> alone and in combination inhibit glioma cell adhesion by downregulating <mark>CD151</mark> and its associated signaling molecules in vitro and in vivo.
Taken together, the results of the present study show that targeting the <mark>uPAR</mark>-<mark>cathepsin B</mark> system has possible therapeutic potential.
Epididymal protein <mark>Rnase10</mark> is required for post-testicular sperm maturation and male fertility.
Eutherian spermatozoa are dependent on the environment of the proximal epididymis to complete their maturation; however, no specific epididymal factors that mediate this process have so far been identified.
Here, we show that targeted disruption of the novel gene <mark>Rnase10</mark> encoding a secreted proximal epididymal protein in the mouse results in a binding defect in spermatozoa and their inability to pass through the uterotubal junction in the female.
The failure to gain the site of fertilization in the knockout spermatozoa is associated with a gradual loss of <mark>ADAM3</mark> and <mark>ADAM6</mark> proteins during epididymal transit.
In the distal epididymis, these spermatozoa appear to lack calcium-dependent associations with the immobilizing glutinous extracellular material and are released as single, vigorously motile cells that display no tendency for head-to-head agglutination and lack affinity to the oviductal epithelium.
In sperm-egg binding assay, they are unable to establish a tenacious association with the zona pellucida, yet they are capable of fertilization.
Furthermore, these sperm show accelerated capacitation resulting in an overall in vitro fertilizing ability superior to that of wild-type sperm.
We conclude that the physiological role of sperm adhesiveness is in the mechanism of restricted sperm entry into the oviduct rather than in sperm-egg interaction.
Gene profile of <mark>chemokines</mark> on hepatic stellate cells of schistosome-infected mice and antifibrotic roles of <mark>CXCL9/10</mark> on liver non-parenchymal cells.
Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play a key role in the development of liver fibrosis caused by schistosomiasis.
<mark>Chemokines</mark> were widely expressed and involved in cellular activation, proliferation and migration in inflammatory and infectious diseases.
However, little is known about the expressions of <mark>chemokines</mark> on HSCs in the schistosoma infection.
In addition, the roles of <mark>chemokines</mark> in pathogenesis of liver fibrosis are not totally clear.
In our study, we used microarray to analyze the temporal gene expressions of primary HSCs isolated from mice with both acute and chronic schistosomiasis.
Our microarray data showed that most of the <mark>chemokines</mark> expressed on HSCs were upregulated at 3 weeks post-infection (p.i) when the egg granulomatous response was not obviously evoked in the liver.
However, some of them like <mark>CXCL9</mark>, <mark>CXCL10</mark> and <mark>CXCL11</mark> were subsequently decreased at 6 weeks p.i when the granulomatous response reached the peak.
In the chronic stage, most of the differentially expressed <mark>chemokines</mark> maintained persistent high-abundances.
Furthermore, several <mark>chemokines</mark> including <mark>CCR2</mark>, <mark>CCR5</mark>, <mark>CCR7</mark>, <mark>CXCR3</mark>, <mark>CXCR4</mark>, <mark>CCL2</mark>, <mark>CCL5</mark>, <mark>CCL21</mark>, <mark>CXCL9</mark> and <mark>CXCL10</mark> were expressed by HCSs and the abundances of them were changed following the praziquantel treatment in the chronic stage, indicating that <mark>chemokines</mark> were possibly necessary for the persistence of the chronic stage.
In vitro experiments, hepatic non-parenchymal cells, primary HSCs and human HSCs line LX-2 were stimulated by <mark>chemokines</mark>.
The results showed that <mark>CXCL9</mark> and <mark>CXCL10</mark>, but not <mark>CXCL11</mark> or <mark>CXCL4</mark>, significantly inhibited the gene expressions of <mark>Col1α1</mark>, <mark>Col3α1</mark> and <mark>α-SMA</mark>, indicating the potential anti-fibrosis effect of <mark>CXCL9</mark> and <mark>CXCL10</mark> in schistosomiasis.
More interestingly, soluble egg antigen (SEA) of Schistosoma japonicum was able to inhibit transcriptional expressions of some <mark>chemokines</mark> by LX-2 cells, suggesting that SEA was capable of regulating the expression pattern of <mark>chemokine</mark> family and modulating the hepatic immune microenvironment in schistosomiasis.
Altered <mark>AKT1</mark> and <mark>MAPK1</mark> gene expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and correlation with T-helper-transcription factors in systemic lupus erythematosus patients.
<mark>Kinases</mark> have been implicated in the immunopathological mechanisms of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).
<mark>v-akt murine-thymoma viral-oncogene-homolog 1</mark> (<mark>AKT1</mark>) and <mark>mitogen-activated-protein-kinase 1</mark> (<mark>MAPK1</mark>) gene expressions in peripheral mononuclear cells from thirteen SLE patients with inactive or mild disease were evaluated using quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction and analyzed whether there was any correlation with T-helper (Th) transcription factors (TF) gene expression, <mark>cytokines</mark>, and <mark>S100A8</mark>/<mark>S100A9</mark>-(<mark>Calprotectin</mark>).
Age- and gender-matched thirteen healthy controls were examined.
<mark>AKT1</mark> and <mark>MAPK1</mark> expressions were upregulated in SLE patients and correlated with Th17-(<mark>Retinoic acid-related orphan receptor</mark> <mark>(ROR)-C)</mark>, T-regulatory-(Treg)-(<mark>Transforming Growth Factor Beta</mark> <mark>(TGFB)-2)</mark>, and Th2-<mark>(interleukin (IL)-5)</mark>-related genes.
<mark>MAPK1</mark> expression correlated with Th1-(<mark>IL-12A</mark>, <mark>T-box TF</mark>-(<mark>T-bet</mark>)), Th2-(<mark>GATA binding protein-(GATA)-3</mark>), and <mark>IL-10</mark> expressions.
<mark>IL-10</mark> expression was increased and correlated with plasma <mark>Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha</mark> and Th0-(<mark>IL-2</mark>), Th1-(<mark>IL-12A</mark>, <mark>T-bet</mark>), <mark>GATA3</mark>, Treg-(<mark>Forkhead/winged-helix transcription factor</mark>- <mark>(FOXP)-3)</mark>, and <mark>IL-6</mark> expressions.
<mark>FOXP3</mark> expression, <mark>FOXP3</mark>/<mark>RORC</mark>, and <mark>FOXP3</mark>/<mark>GATA3</mark> expression ratios were increased.
Plasma <mark>IL-1beta</mark>, <mark>IL-12(p70)</mark>, <mark>Interferon-(IFN)-gamma</mark>, and <mark>IL-6</mark> <mark>cytokines</mark> were augmented.
Plasma <mark>IL-1beta</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-2</mark>, <mark>IFN-gamma</mark>, <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>, <mark>IL-10</mark>, and <mark>IL-13</mark> correlated with <mark>C-reactive protein</mark>, respectively.
Increased <mark>Calprotectin</mark> correlated with neutrophils.
Conclusion, SLE patients presented a systemic immunoinflammatory activity, augmented <mark>AKT1</mark> and <mark>MAPK1</mark> expressions, <mark>proinflammatory cytokines</mark>, and <mark>Calprotectin</mark>, together with increased expression of <mark>Treg-related genes</mark>, suggesting a regulatory feedback opposing the inflammatory activity.
<mark>MyD88</mark> is crucial for the development of a protective CNS immune response to Toxoplasma gondii infection.
BACKGROUND: Toxoplasmosis is one of the most common parasitic infections in humans.
It can establish chronic infection and is characterized by the formation of tissue cysts in the brain.
The cysts remain largely quiescent for the life of the host, but can reactivate and cause life-threatening toxoplasmic encephalitis in immunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS, neoplastic diseases and organ transplants.
<mark>Toll-like receptor</mark> (<mark>TLR</mark>) adaptor <mark>MyD88</mark> activation is required for the innate sensing of Toxoplasma gondii.
Mice deficient in <mark>MyD88</mark> have defective <mark>IL-12</mark> and Th1 effector responses, and are highly susceptible to the acute phase of T. gondii infection.
However, the role of this signaling pathway during cerebral infection is poorly understood and requires examination.
METHOD: <mark>MyD88</mark>-deficient mice and control mice were orally infected with T. gondii cysts.
Cellular and parasite infiltration in the peripheral organs and in the brain were determined by histology and immunohistochemistry.
<mark>Cytokine</mark> levels were determined by ELISA and <mark>chemokine</mark> mRNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR (qPCR).
RESULTS: Thirteen days after infection, a higher parasite burden was observed but there was no histological change in the liver, heart, lungs and small intestine of <mark>MyD88</mark>⁻/⁻ and <mark>MyD88</mark>⁺/⁺ mice.
However, <mark>MyD88</mark>⁻/⁻ mice compared to <mark>MyD88</mark>⁺/⁺ mice were highly susceptible to cerebral infection, displayed high parasite migration to the brain, severe neuropathological signs of encephalitis and succumbed within 2 weeks of oral infection.
Susceptibility was primarily associated with lower expression of <mark>Th1 cytokin<mark>cytokines</mark>, especially <mark>IL-12</mark>, <mark>IFN-γ</mark> and <mark>TNF-α</mark>, significant decrease in the expression of <mark>CCL3</mark>, <mark>CCL5</mark>, <mark>CCL7</mark> and <mark>CCL19</mark> <mark>chemokines</mark>, marked defect of CD8⁺ T cells, and infiltration of <mark>CD11b</mark>⁺ and <mark>F4/80</mark>⁺ cells in the brain.
CONCLUSION: <mark>MyD88</mark> is essential for the protection of mice during the cerebral installation of T. gondii infection.
These results establish a role for <mark>MyD88</mark> in T cell-mediated control of T. gondii in the central nervous system (CNS).
Network of brain protein level changes in <mark>glutaminase</mark> deficient fetal mice.
<mark>Glutaminase</mark> is a multifunctional enzyme encoded by gene <mark>Gls</mark> involved in energy metabolism, ammonia trafficking and regeneration of neurotransmitter glutamate.
To address the proteomic basis for the neurophenotypes of <mark>glutaminase</mark>-deficient mice, brain proteins from late gestation wild type, <mark>Gls</mark>+/- and <mark>Gls</mark>-/- male mice were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, with subsequent identification by mass spectrometry using nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS.
Protein spots that showed differential genotypic variation were quantified by immunoblotting.
Differentially expressed proteins unambiguously identified by MS/MS included <mark>neurocalcin delta</mark>, <mark>retinol binding protein-1</mark>, <mark>reticulocalbin-3</mark>, <mark>cytoskeleton proteins</mark> <mark>fascin</mark> and <mark>tropomyosin alpha-4-chain</mark>, <mark>dihydropyrimidinase-related protein-5</mark>, <mark>apolipoprotein IV</mark> and proteins from protein metabolism <mark>proteasome subunits alpha type 2, type 7</mark>, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/C2 and H, voltage-gated anion-selective channel proteins 1 and 2, <mark>ATP synthase subunit beta</mark> and <mark>transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase</mark>.
An interaction network determined by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed a link between <mark>glutaminase</mark> and calcium, <mark>Akt</mark> and retinol signaling, cytoskeletal elements, <mark>ATPases</mark>, <mark>ion channels</mark>, protein synthesis and the proteasome system, intermediary, nucleic acid and lipid metabolism, <mark>huntingtin</mark>, guidance cues, <mark>transforming growth factor beta-1</mark> and <mark>hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha</mark>.
The network identified involves (a) cellular assembly and organization and (b) cell signaling and cell cycle, suggesting that <mark>Gls</mark> is crucial for neuronal maturation.
An angiogenic role for <mark>adrenomedullin</mark> in choroidal neovascularization.
PURPOSE: <mark>Adrenomedullin</mark> (<mark>ADM</mark>) has been shown to take part in physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether <mark>ADM</mark> signaling is involved in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) using a mouse model.
METHODS AND RESULTS: CNV was induced by laser photocoagulation in 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice.
<mark>ADM</mark> mRNA expression significantly increased following treatment, peaking 4 days thereafter.
The expression of <mark>ADM receptor</mark> (<mark>ADM-R</mark>) components (<mark>CRLR</mark>, <mark>RAMP2</mark> and <mark>RAMP 3</mark>) was higher in <mark>CD31</mark>(+)<mark>CD45</mark>(-) endothelial cells (ECs) than <mark>CD31</mark>(-)<mark>CD45</mark>(-) non-ECs.
Inflammatory stimulation upregulated the expression of <mark>ADM</mark> not only in cell lines but also in cells in primary cultures of the choroid/retinal pigment epithelium complex.
Supernatants from <mark>TNFα</mark>-treated macrophage cell lines potentiated the proliferation of ECs and this was partially suppressed by an <mark>ADM</mark> antagonist, <mark>ADM</mark> (22-52).
Intravitreous injection of <mark>ADM</mark> (22-52) or <mark>ADM</mark> neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) after laser treatment significantly reduced the size of CNV compared with vehicle-treated controls (p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: <mark>ADM</mark> signaling is involved in laser-induced CNV formation, because both an <mark>ADM</mark> antagonist and <mark>ADM</mark> mAb significantly inhibited it.
Suppression of <mark>ADM</mark> signaling might be a valuable alternative treatment for CNV associated with age-related macular degeneration.
The <mark>LIM-Homeodomain transcription factor</mark> <mark>Islet-1</mark> is required for the development of sympathetic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells.
<mark>Islet-1</mark> is a <mark>LIM-Homeodomain transcription factor</mark> with important functions for the development of distinct neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations.
We show here that <mark>Islet-1</mark> acts genetically downstream of <mark>Phox2B</mark> in cells of the sympathoadrenal cell lineage and that the development of sympathetic neurons and chromaffin cells is impaired in mouse embryos with a conditional deletion of <mark>Islet-1</mark> controlled by the <mark>wnt1</mark> promotor.
<mark>Islet-1</mark> is not essential for the initial differentiation of sympathoadrenal cells, as indicated by the correct expression of pan-neuronal and catecholaminergic subtype specific genes in primary sympathetic ganglia of <mark>Islet-1</mark> deficient mouse embryos.
However, our data indicate that the subsequent survival of sympathetic neuron precursors and their differentiation towards <mark>TrkA</mark> expressing neurons depends on <mark>Islet-1</mark> function.
In contrast to spinal sensory neurons, sympathetic neurons of <mark>Islet-1</mark> deficient mice did not display ectopic expression of genes normally present in the CNS.
In <mark>Islet-1</mark> deficient mouse embryos the numbers of chromaffin cells were only mildly reduced, in contrast to that of sympathetic neurons, but the initiation of the adrenaline synthesizing enzyme <mark>PNMT</mark> was abrogated and the expression level of <mark>chromogranin A</mark> was diminished.
Microarray analysis revealed that developing chromaffin cells of <mark>Islet-1</mark> deficient mice displayed normal expression levels of <mark>TH</mark>, <mark>DBH</mark> and the transcription factors <mark>Phox2B</mark>, <mark>Mash-1</mark>, <mark>Hand2</mark>, <mark>Gata3</mark> and <mark>Insm1</mark>, but the expression levels of the transcription factors <mark>Gata2</mark> and <mark>Hand1</mark>, and <mark>AP-2b</mark> were significantly reduced.
Together our data indicate that <mark>Islet-1</mark> is not essentially required for the initial differentiation of sympathoadrenal cells, but has an important function for the correct subsequent development of sympathetic neurons and chromaffin cells.
<mark>MiR-155</mark> has a protective role in the development of non-alcoholic hepatosteatosis in mice.
Hepatic steatosis is a global epidemic that is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.
MicroRNAs (miRs) are regulators that can functionally integrate a range of metabolic and inflammatory pathways in liver.
We aimed to investigate the functional role of <mark>miR-155</mark> in hepatic steatosis.
Male C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and <mark>miR-155</mark>(-/-) mice were fed either normal chow or high fat diet (HFD) for 6 months then lipid levels, metabolic and inflammatory parameters were assessed in livers and serum of the mice.
Mice lacking endogenous <mark>miR-155</mark> that were fed HFD for 6 months developed increased hepatic steatosis compared to WT controls.
This was associated with increased liver weight and serum VLDL/LDL cholesterol and <mark>alanine transaminase</mark> (<mark>ALT</mark>) levels, as well as increased hepatic expression of genes involved in glucose regulation (<mark>Pck1</mark>, <mark>Cebpa</mark>), fatty acid uptake (<mark>Cd36</mark>) and lipid metabolism (<mark>Fasn</mark>, <mark>Fabp4</mark>, <mark>Lpl</mark>, <mark>Abcd2</mark>, <mark>Pla2g7</mark>).
Using miRNA target prediction algorithms and the microarray transcriptomic profile of <mark>miR-155</mark>(-/-) livers, we identified and validated that <mark>Nr1h3</mark> (<mark>LXRα</mark>) as a direct <mark>miR-155</mark> target gene that is potentially responsible for the liver phenotype of <mark>miR-155</mark>(-/-) mice.
Together these data indicate that <mark>miR-155</mark> plays a pivotal role regulating lipid metabolism in liver and that its deregulation may lead to hepatic steatosis in patients with diabetes.
A homozygous mutation in <mark>LYRM7</mark>/<mark>MZM1L</mark> associated with early onset encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and severe reduction of mitochondrial complex III activity.
Mutations in nuclear genes associated with defective complex III (cIII) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are rare, having been found in only two cIII assembly factors and, as private changes in single families, three cIII structural subunits.
Recently, human <mark>LYRM7</mark>/<mark>MZM1L</mark>, the ortholog of yeast <mark>MZM1</mark>, has been identified as a new assembly factor for cIII.
In a baby patient with early onset, severe encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and profound, isolated cIII deficiency in skeletal muscle, we identified a disease-segregating homozygous mutation (c.73G>A) in <mark>LYRM7</mark>/<mark>MZM1L</mark>, predicting a drastic change in a highly conserved amino-acid residue (p.Asp25Asn).
In a <mark>mzm1</mark>Δ yeast strain, the expression of a <mark>mzm1</mark>(D25N) mutant allele caused temperature-sensitive respiratory growth defect, decreased oxygen consumption, impaired maturation/stabilization of the <mark>Rieske Fe-S protein</mark>, and reduced complex III activity and amount.
<mark>LYRM7</mark>/<mark>MZM1L</mark> is a novel disease gene, causing cIII-defective, early onset, severe mitochondrial encephalopathy.
<mark>Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine</mark> (<mark>SPARC</mark>) exacerbates colonic inflammatory symptoms in dextran sodium sulphate-induced murine colitis.
BACKGROUND: <mark>Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine</mark> (<mark>SPARC</mark>) is expressed during tissue repair and regulates cellular proliferation, migration and <mark>cytokine</mark> expression.
The aim was to determine if <mark>SPARC</mark> modifies intestinal inflammation.
METHODS: Wild-type (WT) and <mark>SPARC</mark>-null (KO) mice received 3% dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) for 7 days.
Inflammation was assessed endoscopically, clinically and histologically.
<mark>IL-1beta</mark>, <mark>IL-4</mark>, <mark>IL-5</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-10</mark>, <mark>IL-13</mark>, <mark>IL-17A</mark>, <mark>IL-12/IL23p40</mark>, <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>, <mark>IFN-gamma</mark>, <mark>RANTES</mark>, <mark>MCP-1</mark>, <mark>MIP-1alpha</mark>, <mark>MIP-1beta</mark>, <mark>MIG</mark> and <mark>TGF-beta1</mark> levels were measured by ELISA and cytometric bead array.
Inflammatory cells were characterised by <mark>CD68</mark>, <mark>Ly6G</mark>, <mark>F4/80</mark> and <mark>CD11b</mark> immunofluorescence staining and regulatory T cells from spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were assessed by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: KO mice had less weight loss and diarrhoea with less endoscopic and histological inflammation than WT animals.
By day 35, all (n = 13) KO animals completely resolved the inflammation compared to 7 of 14 WT mice (p&lt;0.01).
Compared to WTs, KO animals at day 7 had less <mark>IL1beta</mark> (p= 0.025) and <mark>MIG</mark> (p = 0.031) with higher <mark>TGFbeta1</mark> (p = 0.017) expression and a greater percentage of <mark>FoxP3</mark>+ regulatory T cells in the spleen and draining lymph nodes of KO animals (p&lt;0.01).
KO mice also had fewer <mark>CD68</mark>+ and <mark>F4/80</mark>+ macrophages, <mark>Ly6G</mark>+ neutrophils and <mark>CD11b</mark>+ cells infiltrating the inflamed colon.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to WT, <mark>SPARC</mark> KO mice had less inflammation with fewer inflammatory cells and more regulatory T cells.
Together, with increased <mark>TGF-beta1</mark> levels, this could aid in the more rapid resolution of inflammation and restoration of the intestinal mucosa suggesting that the presence of <mark>SPARC</mark> increases intestinal inflammation.
Association of a <mark>FGFR-4</mark> gene polymorphism with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and neonatal respiratory distress.
BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of premature birth, characterized by impaired alveolar development and inflammation.
Pathomechanisms contributing to BPD are poorly understood.
However, it is assumed that genetic factors predispose to BPD and other pulmonary diseases of preterm neonates, such as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).
For association studies, genes upregulated during alveolarization are major candidates for genetic analysis, for example, matrix metalloproteinases (<mark>MMPs</mark>) and fibroblast growth factors (<mark>FGFs</mark>) and their receptors (<mark>FGFR</mark>).
OBJECTIVE: Determining genetic risk variants in a Caucasian population of premature neonates with BPD and RDS.
Methods.
We genotyped 27 polymorphisms within 14 candidate genes via restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP): <mark>MMP-1, -2, -9, and -12, -16</mark>, <mark>FGF receptors 2 and 4</mark>, <mark>FGF-2, -3, -4, -7, and -18</mark>, <mark>Signal-Regulatory Protein α</mark> (<mark>SIRPA</mark>) and <mark>Thyroid Transcription Factor-1</mark> (<mark>TTF-1</mark>).
RESULTS: Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <mark>MMP-9</mark>, <mark>MMP-12</mark>, <mark>FGFR-4</mark>, <mark>FGF-3</mark>, and <mark>FGF-7</mark> are associated (P < 0.05) with RDS, defined as surfactant application within the first 24 hours after birth.
One of them, in <mark>FGFR-4</mark> (rs1966265), is associated with both RDS (P = 0.003) and BPD (P = 0.023).
CONCLUSION: rs1966265 in <mark>FGF receptor 4</mark> is a possible genetic key variant in alveolar diseases of preterm newborns.
<mark>Miz1</mark> deficiency in the mammary gland causes a lactation defect by attenuated <mark>Stat5</mark> expression and phosphorylation.
<mark>Miz1</mark> is a <mark>zinc finger transcription factor</mark> with an N-terminal POZ domain.
Complexes with <mark>Myc</mark>, <mark>Bcl-6</mark> or <mark>Gfi-1</mark> repress expression of genes like <mark>Cdkn2b</mark> (<mark>p15(Ink4)</mark>) or <mark>Cdkn1a</mark> (<mark>p21(Cip<mark>p21(Cip1)</mark>).
The role of <mark>Miz1</mark> in normal mammary gland development has not been addressed so far.
Conditional knockout of the <mark>Miz1</mark> POZ domain in luminal cells during pregnancy caused a lactation defect with a transient reduction of glandular tissue, reduced proliferation and attenuated differentiation.
This was recapitulated in vitro using mouse mammary gland derived HC11 cells.
Further analysis revealed decreased <mark>Stat5</mark> activity in <mark>Miz1</mark>ΔPOZ mammary glands and an attenuated expression of <mark>Stat5</mark> targets.
Gene expression of the <mark>Prolactin receptor</mark> (<mark>PrlR</mark>) and <mark>ErbB4</mark>, both critical for <mark>Stat5</mark> phosphorylation (<mark>pStat5</<mark>Stat5)</mark> or <mark>pStat5</<mark>Stat5</mark> nuclear translocation, was decreased in <mark>Miz1</mark>ΔPOZ females.
Microarray, ChIP-Seq and gene set enrichment analysis revealed a down-regulation of <mark>Miz1</mark> target genes being involved in vesicular transport processes.
Our data suggest that deranged intracellular transport and localization of <mark>PrlR</mark> and <mark>ErbB4</mark> disrupt the <mark>Stat5</mark> signalling pathway in mutant glands and cause the observed lactation phenotype.
High <mark>STAT1</mark> mRNA levels but not its tyrosine phosphorylation are associated with macrophage infiltration and bad prognosis in breast cancer.
BACKGROUND: <mark>STAT1</mark> has been attributed a function as <mark>tumor suppressor</mark>.
However, in breast cancer data from microarray analysis indicated a predictive value of high mRNA expression levels of <mark>STAT1</mark> and <mark>STAT1</mark> target genes belonging to the <mark>interferon</mark>-related signature for a poor response to therapy.
To clarify this issue we have determined <mark>STAT1</mark> expression levels and activation by different methods, and investigated their association with tumor infiltration by immune cells.
Additionally, we evaluated the interrelationship of these parameters and their significance for predicting disease outcome.
METHODS: Expression of <mark>STAT1</mark>, its target genes <mark>SOCS1</mark>, <mark>IRF1</mark>, <mark>CXCL9</mark>, <mark>CXCL10</mark>, <mark>CXCL11</mark>, <mark>IFIT1</mark>, <mark>IFITM1</mark>, <mark>MX1</mark> and genes characteristic for immune cell infiltration (<mark>CD68</mark>, <mark>CD163</mark>, <mark>PD-L1</mark>, <mark>PD-L2</mark>, <mark>PD-1</mark>, <mark>CD45</mark>, <mark>IFN-gamma</mark>, <mark>FOXP3</mark>) was determined by RT-PCR in two independent cohorts comprising 132 breast cancer patients.
For a subset of patients, protein levels of total as well as serine and tyrosine-phosphorylated <mark>STAT1</mark> were ascertained by immunohistochemistry or immunoblotting and protein levels of <mark>CXCL10</mark> by ELISA.
RESULTS: mRNA expression levels of <mark>STAT1</mark> and <mark>STAT1</mark> target genes, as well as protein levels of total and serine-phosphorylated <mark>STAT1</mark> correlated with each other in neoplastic tissue.
However, there was no association between tumor levels of <mark>STAT1</mark> mRNA and tyrosine-phosphorylated <mark>STAT1</mark> and between <mark>CXCL10</mark> serum levels and <mark>CXCL10</mark> expression in the tumor.
Tumors with increased <mark>STAT1</mark> mRNA amounts exhibited elevated expression of genes characteristic for tumor-associated macrophages and immunosuppressive T lymphocytes.
Survival analysis revealed an association of high <mark>STAT1</mark> mRNA levels and bad prognosis in both cohorts.
A similar prognostically relevant correlation with unfavorable outcome was evident for <mark>CXCL10</mark>, <mark>MX1</mark>, <mark>CD68</mark>, <mark>CD163</mark>, <mark>IFN-gamma</mark>, and <mark>PD-L2</mark> expression in at least one collective.
By contrast, activation of <mark>STAT1</mark> as assessed by the level of <mark>STAT1</mark>-Y701 phosphorylation was linked to positive outcome.
In multivariate Cox regression, the predictive power of <mark>STAT1</mark> mRNA expression was lost when including expression of <mark>CXCL10</mark>, <mark>MX1</mark> and <mark>CD68</mark> as confounders.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms distinct prognostic relevance of <mark>STAT1</mark> expression levels and <mark>STAT1</mark> tyrosine phosphorylation in breast cancer patients and identifies an association of high <mark>STAT1</mark> levels with elevated expression of <mark>STAT1</mark> target genes and markers for infiltrating immune cells.
Essential roles of epithelial <mark>bone morphogenetic protein</mark> signaling during prostatic development.
Prostate is a male sex-accessory organ.
The prostatic epithelia consist primarily of basal and luminal cells that differentiate from embryonic urogenital sinus epithelia.
Prostate tumors are believed to originate in the basal and luminal cells.
However, factors that promote normal epithelial differentiation have not been well elucidated, particularly for <mark>bone morphogenetic protein</mark> (<mark>Bmp</mark>) signaling.
This study shows that <mark>Bmp</mark> signaling prominently increases during prostatic differentiation in the luminal epithelia, which is monitored by the expression of phosphorylated <mark>Smad1/5/8</mark>.
To elucidate the mechanism of epithelial differentiation and the function of <mark>Bmp</mark> signaling during prostatic development, conditional male mutant mouse analysis for the epithelial-specific <mark>Bmp receptor 1a</mark> (<mark>Bmpr1a</mark>) was performed.
We demonstrate that <mark>Bmp</mark> signaling is indispensable for luminal cell maturation, which regulates basal cell proliferation.
Expression of the prostatic epithelial regulatory gene <mark>Nkx3.1</mark> was significantly reduced in the <mark>Bmpr1a</mark> mutants.
These results indicate that <mark>Bmp</mark> signaling is a key factor for prostatic epithelial differentiation, possibly by controlling the prostatic regulatory gene <mark>Nkx3.1</mark>.
Crucial role of calbindin-D28k in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
<mark>Calbindin-D28k</mark> (<mark>CB</mark>), one of the major calcium-binding and buffering proteins, has a critical role in preventing a neuronal death as well as maintaining calcium homeostasis.
Although marked reductions of <mark>CB</mark> expression have been observed in the brains of mice and humans with Alzheimer disease (AD), it is unknown whether these changes contribute to AD-related dysfunction.
To determine the pathogenic importance of CB depletions in AD models, we crossed 5 familial AD mutations (5XFAD; Tg) mice with CB knock-out (CBKO) mice and generated a novel line CBKO·5XFAD (CBKOTg) mice.
We first identified the change of signaling pathways and differentially expressed proteins globally by removing CB in Tg mice using mass spectrometry and antibody microarray.
Immunohistochemistry showed that CBKOTg mice had significant neuronal loss in the subiculum area without changing the magnitude (number) of <mark>amyloid β-peptide</mark> (<mark>Aβ</mark>) plaques deposition and elicited significant apoptotic features and mitochondrial dysfunction compared with Tg mice.
Moreover, CBKOTg mice reduced levels of phosphorylated <mark>mitogen-activated protein kinase</mark> (<mark>extracellular signal-regulated kinase) 1/2</mark> and cAMP response element-binding protein at Ser-133 and synaptic molecules such as <mark>N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1</mark> (<mark>NMDA receptor 1</mark>), <mark>NMDA receptor 2A</mark>, <mark>PSD-95</mark> and <mark>synaptophysin</mark> in the subiculum compared with Tg mice.
Importantly, this is the first experimental evidence that removal of CB from <mark>amyloid precursor protein</mark>/<mark>presenilin</mark> transgenic mice aggravates AD pathogenesis, suggesting that CB has a critical role in AD pathogenesis.
Elongated <mark>TCR alpha</mark> chain <mark>CDR3</mark> favors an altered <mark>CD4</mark> <mark>cytokine</mark> profile.
BACKGROUND: <mark>CD4</mark> T lymphocyte activation requires <mark>T cell receptor</mark> (<mark>TCR</mark>) engagement by peptide/<mark>MHC</mark> (<mark>major histocompatibility complex</mark>) (p<mark>MHC</mark>).
The <mark>TCR</mark> <mark>complementarity-determining region 3</mark> (<mark>CDR3</mark>) contains variable α and β loops critical for p<mark>MHC</mark> recognition.
During any immune response, tuning of <mark>TCR</mark> usage through progressive clonal selection occurs.
Th1 and Th2 cells operate at different avidities for activation and display distinct transcriptional programs, although polarization may be plastic, influenced by pathogens and <mark>cytokines</mark>.
We therefore hypothesized that <mark>CDR3αβ</mark> sequence features may intrinsically influence <mark>CD4</mark> phenotype during progression of a response.
RESULTS: We show that <mark>CD4</mark> polarization involves distinct <mark>CDR3α</mark> usage: Th1 and Th17 cells favored short <mark>TCR</mark> <mark>CDR3α</mark> sequences of 12 and 11 amino acids, respectively, while Th2 cells favored elongated <mark>CDR3α</mark> loops of 14 amino acids, with lower predicted affinity.
The dominant Th2- and Th1-derived <mark>TCRα</mark> sequences with 14 amino acid <mark>CDR3</mark> loops and 12 amino acid <mark>CDR3</mark> loops, respectively, were expressed in <mark>TCR</mark> transgenics.
The functional impact of these <mark>TCRα</mark> transgenes was assessed after in vivo priming with a peptide/adjuvant.
The short, Th1-derived receptor transgenic T cell lines made <mark>IFNγ</mark>, but not <mark>IL-4, 5 or 13</mark>, while the elongated, Th2-derived receptor transgenic T cell lines made little or no <mark>IFNγ</mark>, but increased <mark>IL-4, 5 and 13</mark> with progressive re-stimulations, mirrored by <mark>GATA-3</mark> up-regulation.
T cells from primed Th2 <mark>TCRα</mark> transgenics selected dominant <mark>TCR Vβ</mark> expansions, allowing us to generate <mark>TCRαβ</mark> transgenics carrying the favored, Th2-derived receptor heterodimer.
Primed T cells from <mark>TCRαβ</mark> transgenics made little or no <mark>IL-17</mark> or <mark>IFNγ</mark>, but favored <mark>IL-9</mark> after priming with Complete Freund's adjuvant and <mark>IL-4, 5, 9, 10 and 13</mark> after priming with incomplete Freund's.
In tetramer-binding studies, this transgenic receptor showed low binding avidity for pMHC and polarized T cell lines show <mark>TCR</mark> avidity for Th17 > Th1 > Th2.
While transgenic expression of a Th2-derived, 'elongated' <mark>TCR</mark>-<mark>CDR3α</mark> and the <mark>TCRαβ</mark> pair, clearly generated a program shifted away from Th1 immunity and with low binding avidity, <mark>cytokine</mark>-skewing could be over-ridden by altering peptide challenge dose.
CONCLUSION: We propose that selection from responding clones with distinctive <mark>TCR</mark>s on the basis of functional avidity can direct a preference away from Th1 effector responses, favoring Th2 <mark>cytokines</mark>.
Seed dormancy cycling in Arabidopsis: chromatin remodelling and regulation of <mark>DOG1</mark> in response to seasonal environmental signals.
The involvement of chromatin remodelling in dormancy cycling in the soil seed bank (SSB) is poorly understood.
Natural variation between the winter and summer annual Arabidopsis ecotypes Cvi and Bur was exploited to investigate the expression of genes involved in chromatin remodelling via <mark>histone 2B</mark> (<mark>H2B</mark>) ubiquitination/de-ubiquitination and histone acetylation/deacetylation, the repressive <mark>histone methyl transferases</mark> <mark>CURLY LEAF</mark> (<mark>CLF</mark>) and <mark>SWINGER</mark> (<mark>SWN</mark>), and the gene silencing repressor <mark>ROS1</mark> (<mark>REPRESSOR OF SILENCING1</mark>) and promoter of silencing <mark>KYP</mark>/<mark>SUVH4</mark> (<mark>KRYPTONITE</mark>), during dormancy cycling in the SSB.
<mark>ROS1</mark> expression was positively correlated with dormancy while the reverse was observed for <mark>CLF</mark> and <mark>KYP</mark>/<mark>SUVH4</mark>.
We propose <mark>ROS1</mark> dependent repression of silencing and a sequential requirement of <mark>CLF</mark> and <mark>KYP</mark>/<mark>SUVH4</mark> dependent gene repression and silencing for the maintenance and suppression of dormancy during dormancy cycling.
Seasonal expression of <mark>H2B</mark> modifying genes was correlated negatively with temperature and positively with <mark>DOG1</mark> expression, as were <mark>histone acetyltransferase</mark> genes, with <mark>histone deacetylases</mark> positively correlated with temperature.
Changes in the <mark>histone</mark> marks <mark>H3</mark>K4me3 and <mark>H3</mark>K27me3 were seen on <mark>DOG1</mark> (<mark>DELAY OF GERMINATION1</mark>) in Cvi during dormancy cycling.
<mark>H3</mark>K4me3 activating marks remained stable along <mark>DOG1</mark>.
During relief of dormancy, <mark>H3</mark>K27me3 repressive marks slowly accumulated and accelerated on exposure to light completing dormancy loss.
We propose that these marks on <mark>DOG1</mark> serve as a thermal sensing mechanism during dormancy cycling in preparation for light repression of dormancy.
Overall, chromatin remodelling plays a vital role in temporal sensing through regulation of gene expression.
<mark>AF10</mark> regulates progressive <mark>H3</mark>K79 methylation and <mark>HOX</mark> gene expression in diverse AML subtypes.
<mark>Homeotic (HOX) ge<mark>HOX</mark></mark> are dysregulated in multiple malignancies, including several AML subtypes.
We demonstrate that <mark>H3</mark>K79 dimethylation (<mark>H3</mark>K79me2) is converted to monomethylation <mark>(H3</mark>K79me1) at <mark>HOX</mark> loci as hematopoietic cells mature, thus coinciding with a decrease in <mark>HOX</mark> gene expression.
We show that <mark>H3</mark>K79 methyltransferase activity as well as <mark>H3</mark>K79me1-to-<mark>H3</mark>K79me2 conversion is regulated by the <mark>DOT1L</mark> cofactor <mark>AF10</mark>.
<mark>AF10</mark> inactivation reverses leukemia-associated epigenetic profiles, precludes abnormal <mark>HOXA</mark> gene expression, and impairs the transforming ability of <mark>MLL</mark>-<mark>AF9</mark>, <mark>MLL</mark>-<mark>AF6</mark>, and <mark>NUP98</mark>-<mark>NSD1</mark> fusions-mechanistically distinct <mark>HOX</mark>-activating oncogenes.
Furthermore, <mark>NUP98</mark>-<mark>NSD1</mark>-transformed cells are sensitive to small-molecule inhibition of <mark>DOT1L</mark>.
Our findings demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of the <mark>DOT1L</mark>/<mark>AF10</mark> complex may provide therapeutic benefits in an array of malignancies with abnormal <mark>HOXA</mark> gene expression.
Mesenchymal stem cells promote liver regeneration and prolong survival in small-for-size liver grafts: involvement of <mark>C-Jun N-terminal kinase</mark>, <mark>cyclin D1</mark>, and <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>.
BACKGROUND: The therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been highlighted recently for treatment of acute or chronic liver injury, by possibly differentiating into hepatocyte-like cells, reducing inflammation, and enhancing tissue repair.
Despite recent progress, exact mechanisms of action are not clearly elucidated.
In this study, we attempted to explore whether and how MSCs protected hepatocytes and stimulated allograft regeneration in small-for-size liver transplantation (SFSLT).
METHODS: SFSLT model was established with a 30% partial liver transplantation (30PLT) in rats.
The differentiation potential and characteristics of bone marrow derived MSCs were explored in vitro.
MSCs were infused transvenously immediately after graft implantation in therapy group.
Expressions of apoptosis-, inflammatory-, anti-inflammatory-, and growth factor-related genes were measured by RT-PCR, activities of <mark>transcription factors</mark> <mark>AP-1</mark> and <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> were analyzed by EMSA, and proliferative responses of the hepatic graft were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot.
RESULTS: MSCs were successfully induced into hepatocyte-like cells, osteoblasts and adipocytes in vitro.
MSCs therapy could not only alleviate ischemia reperfusion injury and acute inflammation to promote liver regeneration, but also profoundly improve one week survival rate.
It markedly up-regulated the mRNA expressions of <mark>HGF</mark>, <mark>Bcl-2</mark>, <mark>Bcl-XL</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-10</mark>, <mark>IP-10</mark>, and <mark>CXCR2</mark>, however, down-regulated <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>.
Increased activities of <mark>AP-1</mark> and <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>, as well as elevated expressions of p-<mark>c-Jun</mark>, <mark>cyclin D1</mark>, and <mark>proliferating cell nuclear antigen</mark> (<mark>PCNA</mark>), were also found in MSCs therapy group.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that MSCs therapy promotes hepatocyte proliferation and prolongs survival in SFSLT by reducing ischemia reperfusion injury and acute inflammation, and sustaining early increased expressions of <mark>c-Jun N-terminal Kinase</mark>, <mark>Cyclin D1</mark>, and <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>.
Multipotent caudal neural progenitors derived from human pluripotent stem cells that give rise to lineages of the central and peripheral nervous system.
The caudal neural plate is a distinct region of the embryo that gives rise to major progenitor lineages of the developing central and peripheral nervous system, including neural crest and floor plate cells.
We show that dual inhibition of the <mark>glycogen synthase kinase 3β</mark> and <mark>activin</mark>/<mark>nodal</mark> pathways by small molecules differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) directly into a preneuroepithelial progenitor population we named "caudal neural progenitors" (CNPs).
CNPs coexpress caudal neural plate and mesoderm markers, and, share high similarities to embryonic caudal neural plate cells in their lineage differentiation potential.
Exposure of CNPs to <mark>BMP2/4</mark>, sonic hedgehog, or <mark>FGF2</mark> signaling efficiently directs their fate to neural crest/roof plate cells, floor plate cells, and caudally specified neuroepithelial cells, respectively.
Neural crest derived from CNPs differentiated to neural crest derivatives and demonstrated extensive migratory properties in vivo.
Importantly, we also determined the key extrinsic factors specifying CNPs from human embryonic stem cell include <mark>FGF8</mark>, canonical <mark>WNT</mark>, and <mark>IGF1</mark>.
Our studies are the first to identify a multipotent neural progenitor derived from hPSCs, that is the precursor for major neural lineages of the embryonic caudal neural tube.
<mark>Extracellular superoxide dismutase</mark> regulates the expression of <mark>small gtpase regulatory proteins</mark> <mark>GEFs</mark>, <mark>GAPs</mark>, and <mark>GDI</mark>.
<mark>Extracellular superoxide dismutase</mark> (<mark>SOD3</mark>), which catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide at the cell membranes, regulates the cellular growth in a dose-dependent manner.
This enzyme induces primary cell proliferation and immortalization at low expression levels whereas it activates cancer barrier signaling through the <mark>p53</mark>-<mark>p21</mark> pathway at high expression levels, causing growth arrest, senescence, and apoptosis.
Because previous reports suggested that the <mark>SOD3</mark>-induced reduction in the rates of cellular growth and migration also occurred in the absence of functional <mark>p53</mark> signaling, in the current study we investigated the <mark>SOD3</mark>-induced growth-suppressive mechanisms in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells.
Based on our data, the robust over-expression of <mark>SOD3</mark> increased the level of phosphorylation of the <mark>EGFR</mark>, <mark>ERBB2</mark>, <mark>RYK</mark>, <mark>ALK</mark>, <mark>FLT3</mark>, and <mark>EPHA10</mark> <mark>receptor tyrosine kinases</mark> with the consequent downstream activation of the <mark>SRC</mark>, <mark>FYN</mark>, <mark>YES</mark>, <mark>HCK</mark>, and <mark>LYN</mark> <mark>kinases</mark>.
However, pull-down experiments focusing on the <mark>small GTPase</mark> <mark>RAS</mark>, <mark>RAC</mark>, <mark>CDC42</mark>, and <mark>RHO</mark> revealed a reduced level of growth and migration signal transduction, such as the lack of stimulation of the mitogen pathway, in the <mark>SOD3</mark> over-expressing cells, which was confirmed by <mark>MEK1/2</mark> and <mark>ERK1/2</mark> Western blotting analysis.
Interestingly, the mRNA expression analyses indicated that <mark>SOD3</mark> regulated the expression of <mark>guanine nucleotide-exchange factors</mark> (<mark>RHO GEF16</mark>, <mark>RAL GEF RGL1</mark>), <mark>GTPase-activating proteins</mark> (<mark>ARFGAP ADAP2</mark>, <mark>RAS GAP RASAL1</mark>, <mark>RGS4</mark>), and a <mark>Rho guanine nucleotide-disassociation inhibitor</mark> (<mark>RHO GDI 2</mark>) in a dose dependent manner, thus controlling signaling through the <mark>small G protein GTPases</mark>.
Therefore, our current data may suggest the occurrence of dose-dependent <mark>SOD3</mark>-driven control of the GTP loading of <mark>small G proteins</mark> indicating a novel growth regulatory mechanism of this enzyme.
Regulation of <mark>IL-17A</mark> responses in human airway smooth muscle cells by <mark>Oncostatin M</mark>.
BACKGROUND: Regulation of human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMC) by <mark>cytokines</mark> contributes to chemotactic factor levels and thus to inflammatory cell accumulation in lung diseases.
<mark>Cytokines</mark> such as the <mark>gp130</mark> family member <mark>Oncostatin M</mark> (<mark>OSM</mark>) can act synergistically with <mark>Th2 cytokin<mark>cytokines</mark> (<mark>IL-4</mark> and <mark>IL-13</mark>) to modulate lung cells, however whether <mark>IL-17A</mark> responses by HASMC can be altered is not known.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of recombinant <mark>OSM</mark>, or other <mark>gp130 c<mark>gp130</mark>n<mark>cytokines</mark> (<mark>LIF</mark>, <mark>IL-31</mark>, and <mark>IL-6</mark>) in regulating HASMC responses to <mark>IL-17A</mark>, assessing <mark>MCP-1/C<mark>MCP-1</mark>m<mark>CCL2</mark> and <mark>IL-6</mark> expression and cell signaling pathways.
METHODS: Cell responses of primary HASMC cultures were measured by the assessment of protein levels in supernatants (ELISA) and mRNA levels (qRT-PCR) in cell extracts.
Activation of <mark>STAT</mark>, <mark>MAPK</m<mark>MAPK (p38)</m<mark>p38</mark>> and <mark>Akt</mark> pathways were measured by immunoblot.
Pharmacological agents were used to assess the effects of inhibition of these pathways.
RESULTS: <mark>OSM</mark> but not <mark>LIF</mark>, <mark>IL-31</mark> or <mark>IL-6</mark> could induce detectable responses in HASMC, elevating <mark>MCP-1/C<mark>MCP-1</mark>m<mark>CCL2</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark> levels and activation of <mark>STAT-1, 3, 5</mark>, <mark>p38</mark> and <mark>Akt</mark> cell signaling pathways.
<mark>OSM</mark> induced synergistic action with <mark>IL-17A</mark> enhancing <mark>MCP-1</mark>/<mark>CCL-2</mark> and <mark>IL-6</mark> mRNA and protein expression, but not <mark>eotaxin-1</mark> expression, while <mark>OSM</mark> in combination with <mark>IL-4</mark> or <mark>IL-13</mark> synergistically induced <mark>eotaxin-1</mark> and <mark>MCP-1</mark>/<mark>CCL2</mark>.
<mark>OSM</mark> elevated steady state mRNA levels of <mark>IL-4Rα</mark>, <mark>OSMRβ</mark> and <mark>gp130</mark>, but not <mark>IL-17RA</mark> or <mark>IL-17RC</mark>.
Pharmacologic inhibition of <mark>STAT3</mark> activation using Stattic down-regulated <mark>OSM</mark>, <mark>OSM</mark>/<mark>IL-4</mark> or <mark>OSM</mark>/<mark>IL-13</mark>, and <mark>OSM</mark>/<mark>IL-17A</mark> synergistic responses of <mark>MCP-1</mark>/<mark>CCL-2</mark> induction, whereas, inhibitors of <mark>Akt</mark> and <mark>p38</mark> MAPK resulted in less reduction in <mark>MCP-1</mark>/<mark>CCL2</mark> levels.
<mark>IL-6</mark> expression was more sensitive to inhibition of <mark>p38</mark> (using SB203580) and was affected by Stattic in response to <mark>IL-17A</mark>/<mark>OSM</mark> stimulation.
CONCLUSIONS: <mark>Oncostatin M</mark> can regulate HASMC responses alone or in synergy with <mark>IL-17A</mark>.
<mark>OSM</mark>/<mark>IL-17A</mark> combinations enhance <mark>MCP-1</mark>/<mark>CCL2</mark> and <mark>IL-6</mark> but not <mark>eotaxin-1</mark>.
Thus, <mark>OSM</mark> through <mark>STAT3</mark> activation of HASMC may participate in inflammatory cell recruitment in inflammatory airway disease.
<mark>ING5</mark> suppresses proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion, and induces autophagy and differentiation of gastric cancer cells: a good marker for carcinogenesis and subsequent progression.
Here, we found that <mark>ING5</mark> overexpression increased autophagy, differentiation, and decreased proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion and lamellipodia formation in gastric cancer cells, while <mark>ING5</mark> knockdown had the opposite effects.
In SGC-7901 transfectants, <mark>ING5</mark> overexpression caused G1 arrest, which was positively associated with <mark>14-3-3</mark> overexpression, <mark>Cdk4</mark> and <mark>c-jun</mark> hypoexpression.
The induction of <mark>Bax</mark> hypoexpression, <mark>Bcl-2</mark>, <mark>survivin</mark>, <mark>14-3-3</mark>, <mark>PI3K</mark>, p-<mark>Akt</mark> and <mark>p70S6K</mark> overexpression by <mark>ING5</mark> decreased apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells.
The hypoexpression of <mark>MMP-9</mark>, <mark>MAP1B</mark> and <mark>flotillin 2</mark> contributed to the inhibitory effects of <mark>ING5</mark> on migration and invasion of SGC-7901 cells.
<mark>ING5</mark> overexpression might activate both <mark>beta-catenin</mark> and <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> pathways in SGC-7901 cells, and promote the expression of down-stream genes (<mark>c-myc</mark>, <mark>VEGF</mark>, <mark>Cyclin D1</mark>, <mark>survivin</mark>, and <mark>interleukins</mark>).
Compared with the control, <mark>ING5</mark> transfectants displayed drug resistance to triciribine, paclitaxel, cisplatin, SAHA, MG132 and parthenolide, which was positively related to their apoptotic induction and the overexpression of chemoresistance-related genes (<mark>MDR1</mark>, <mark>GRP78</mark>, <mark>GRP94</mark>, <mark>IRE</mark>, <mark>CD147</mark>, <mark>FBXW7</mark>, <mark>TOP1</mark>, <mark>TOP2</mark>, <mark>MLH1</mark>, <mark>MRP1</mark>, <mark>BRCP1</mark> and <mark>GST-pi</mark>).
<mark>ING5</mark> expression was higher in gastric cancer than matched mucosa.
It was inversely associated with tumor size, dedifferentiation, lymph node metastasis and clinicopathological staging of cancer.
<mark>ING5</mark> overexpression suppressed growth, blood supply and lung metastasis of SGC-7901 cells by inhibiting proliferation, enhancing autophagy and apoptosis in xenograft models.
It was suggested that <mark>ING5</mark> expression might be employed as a good marker for gastric carcinogenesis and subsequent progression by inhibiting proliferation, growth, migration, invasion and metastasis.
<mark>ING5</mark> might induce apoptotic and chemotherapeutic resistances of gastric cancer cells by activating <mark>beta-catenin</mark>, <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> and <mark>Akt</mark> pathways.
Protein-Trap Insertional Mutagenesis Uncovers New Genes Involved in Zebrafish Skin Development, Including a <mark>Neuregulin 2a</mark>-Based <mark>ErbB</mark> Signaling Pathway Required during Median Fin Fold Morphogenesis.
Skin disorders are widespread, but available treatments are limited.
A more comprehensive understanding of skin development mechanisms will drive identification of new treatment targets and modalities.
Here we report the Zebrafish Integument Project (ZIP), an expression-driven platform for identifying new skin genes and phenotypes in the vertebrate model Danio rerio (zebrafish).
In vivo selection for skin-specific expression of gene-break transposon (GBT) mutant lines identified eleven new, revertible GBT alleles of genes involved in skin development.
Eight genes--<mark>fras1</mark>, <mark>grip1</mark>, <mark>hmcn1</mark>, <mark>msxc</mark>, <mark>col4a4</mark>, <mark>ahnak</mark>, <mark>capn12</mark>, and <mark>nrg2a</mark>--had been described in an integumentary context to varying degrees, while <mark>arhgef25b</mark>, <mark>fkbp10b</mark>, and <mark>megf6a</mark> emerged as novel skin genes.
Embryos homozygous for a GBT insertion within <mark>neuregulin 2a</mark> (<mark>nrg2a</mark>) revealed a novel requirement for a <mark>Neuregulin 2a</mark> (<mark>Nrg2a</mark>)-<mark>ErbB2/3</mark>-<mark>AKT</mark> signaling pathway governing the apicobasal organization of a subset of epidermal cells during median fin fold (MFF) morphogenesis.
In <mark>nrg2a</mark> mutant larvae, the basal keratinocytes within the apical MFF, known as ridge cells, displayed reduced p<mark>AKT</mark> levels as well as reduced apical domains and exaggerated basolateral domains.
Those defects compromised proper ridge cell elongation into a flattened epithelial morphology, resulting in thickened MFF edges.
Pharmacological inhibition verified that <mark>Nrg2a</mark> signals through the <mark>ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase</mark> network.
Moreover, knockdown of the epithelial polarity regulator and tumor suppressor <mark>lgl2</mark> ameliorated the <mark>nrg2a</mark> mutant phenotype.
Identifying <mark>Lgl2</mark> as an antagonist of <mark>Nrg2a</mark>-<mark>ErbB</mark> signaling revealed a significantly earlier role for <mark>Lgl2</mark> during epidermal morphogenesis than has been described to date.
Furthermore, our findings demonstrated that successive, coordinated ridge cell shape changes drive apical MFF development, making MFF ridge cells a valuable model for investigating how the coordinated regulation of cell polarity and cell shape changes serves as a crucial mechanism of epithelial morphogenesis.
A Transcriptome-Led Exploration of Molecular Mechanisms Regulating <mark>Somatostatin</mark>-Producing D-Cells in the Gastric Epithelium.
The stomach epithelium contains a myriad of enteroendocrine cells that modulate a range of physiological functions, including postprandial secretion of regulatory peptides, gastric motility, and nutrient absorption.
<mark>Somatostatin</mark> (<mark>SST</mark>)-producing D-cells are present in the oxyntic and pyloric regions of the stomach, and provide a tonic inhibitory tone that regulates activity of neighboring enteroendocrine cells and gastric acid secretion.
Cellular mechanisms underlying the effects of regulatory factors on gastric D-cells are poorly defined due to problems in identifying primary D-cells, and uncertainty remains about which stimuli influence D-cells directly.
In this study, we introduce a transgenic mouse line, <mark>SST</mark>-Cre, which upon crossing with Cre reporter strains, facilitates the identification and purification of gastric D-cells, or cell-specific expression of genetically encoded calcium indicators.
Populations of D-cells from the gastric antrum and corpus were isolated and analyzed by RNA sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR.
The expression of hormones, hormone receptors, neurotransmitter receptors, and nutrient receptors was quantified.
<mark>Pyy</mark>, <mark>Gipr</mark>, <mark>Chrm4</mark>, <mark>Calcrl</mark>, <mark>Taar1</mark>, and <mark>Casr</mark> were identified as genes that are highly enriched in D-cells compared with <mark>SST</mark>-negative cells.
Hormone secretion assays performed in mixed gastric epithelial cultures confirmed that <mark>SST</mark> secretion is regulated by <mark>incretin hormones</mark>, <mark>cholecystokinin</mark>, acetylcholine, <mark>vasoactive intestinal polypeptide</mark>, <mark>calcitonin gene-related polypeptide</mark>, oligopetides, and trace amines.
<mark>Cholecystokinin</mark> and oligopeptides elicited increases in intracellular calcium in single-cell imaging experiments performed using cultured D-cells.
Our data provide the first transcriptomic analysis and functional characterization of gastric D-cells, and identify regulatory pathways that underlie the direct detection of stimuli by this cell type.
<mark>G Protein-Coupled Estrogen Receptor 1</mark> Mediates Acute Estrogen-Induced Cardioprotection via <mark>MEK</mark>/<mark>ERK</mark>/<mark>GSK-3β</mark> Pathway after Ischemia/Reperfusion.
Three types of <mark>estrogen receptors</mark> (<mark>ER)</mark> exist in the heart, <mark>Esr1</mark>, <mark>Esr2</mark> and the <mark>G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1</mark>, <mark>Gper1</mark>.
However, their relative importance in mediating estrogen protective action is unknown.
We found that, in the male mouse ventricle, <mark>Gper1</mark> transcripts are three- and seventeen-fold more abundant than <mark>Esr1</mark> and <mark>Esr2</mark> mRNAs, respectively.
Analysis of the three ER knockouts (<mark>Esr1</mark>-/-, <mark>Esr2</mark>-/- and <mark>Gper1</mark>-/-) showed that only the <mark>Gper1</mark>-/- hearts lost their ability to be protected by 40 nM estrogen as measured by heart function, infarct size and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, an index of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) activity.
Analysis of <mark>Akt</mark>, <mark>ERK1/2</mark> and <mark>GSK-3β</mark> salvage kinases uncovered <mark>Akt</mark> and <mark>ERK1/2</mark> transient activation by estrogen whose phosphorylation increased during the first 5 min of non-ischemic perfusion.
All these increase in phosphorylation effects were abrogated in <mark>Gper1</mark>-/-.
Inhibition of <mark>MEK1/2</mark>/<mark>ERK1/2</mark> (1 μM U0126) and <mark>PI-3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> (10 μM LY294002) signaling showed that the <mark>MEK1/2</mark>/<mark>ERK1/2</mark> pathway via <mark>GSK-3β</mark> exclusively was responsible for cardioprotection as an addition of U0126 prevented estrogen-induced <mark>GSK-3β</mark> increased phosphorylation, resistance to mitochondrial Ca2+-overload, functional recovery and protection against infarction.
Further, inhibiting <mark>PKC</mark> translocation (1 μM chelerythrin-chloride) abolished estrogen-induced cardioprotection.
These data indicate that estrogen-<mark>Gper1</mark> acute coupling plays a key role in cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion injury in male mouse via a cascade involving <mark>PKC</mark> translocation, <mark>ERK1/2</mark>/<mark>GSK-3β</mark> phosphorylation leading to the inhibition of the mPTP opening.
<mark>Leptin</mark> Matures Aspects of Lung Structure and Function in the Ovine Fetus.
In human and ovine fetuses, glucocorticoids stimulate <mark>leptin</mark> secretion, although the extent to which <mark>leptin</mark> mediates the maturational effects of glucocorticoids on pulmonary development is unclear.
This study investigated the effects of <mark>leptin</mark> administration on indices of lung structure and function before birth.
Chronically catheterized singleton sheep fetuses were infused iv for 5 days with either saline or recombinant ovine <mark>leptin</mark> (0.5 mg/kg · d <mark>leptin</mark> (<mark>LEP</mark>), 0.5 <mark>LEP</mark> or 1.0 mg/kg · d, 1.0 <mark>LEP</mark>) from 125 days of gestation (term ∼145 d).
Over the infusion, <mark>leptin</mark> administration increased plasma <mark>leptin</mark>, but not cortisol, concentrations.
On the fifth day of infusion, 0.5 <mark>LEP</mark> reduced alveolar wall thickness and increased the volume at closing pressure of the pressure-volume deflation curve, interalveolar septal <mark>elastin</mark> content, secondary septal crest density, and the mRNA abundance of the <mark>leptin receptor</mark> (<mark>Ob-R</mark>) and <mark>surfactant protein (SP) B</mark>.
Neither treatment influenced static lung compliance, maximal lung volume at 40 cmH2O, lung compartment volumes, alveolar surface area, pulmonary glycogen, protein content of the <mark>long form signaling Ob-Rb</mark> or phosphorylated <mark>signal transducers and activators of transcription-3</mark>, or mRNA levels of <mark>SP-A, C, or D</mark>, <mark>elastin</mark>, <mark>vascular endothelial growth factor-A</mark>, the <mark>vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2</mark>, <mark>angiotensin-converting enzyme</mark>, <mark>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ</mark>, or <mark>parathyroid hormone-related peptide</mark>.
<mark>Leptin</mark> administration in the ovine fetus during late gestation promotes aspects of lung maturation, including up-regulation of <mark>SP-B</mark>.
Establishment and characterization of a novel <mark>MYC</mark>/<mark>BCL2</mark> "double-hit" diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell line, RC.
BACKGROUND: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of lymphoid malignancy worldwide.
Approximately 5 % of cases of DLBCL are so-called double-hit lymphomas (DHL), defined by a chromosomal translocation or rearrangement involving <mark>MYC</mark>/8q24.2 in combination with another recurrent breakpoint, usually <mark>BCL2</mark>/18q21.3.
Patients with <mark>MYC</mark>/<mark>BCL2</mark> DHL are resistant to standard front-line therapy, and currently, there is no consensus for a therapeutic strategy to treat these patients.
Lack of clinically relevant or validated human experimental DHL models of any type that would improve our understanding of the biologic basis of <mark>MYC</mark>/<mark>BCL2</mark> DHL pathophysiology continues to hamper identification of valid therapeutic targets.
We describe a unique <mark>MYC</mark>/<mark>BCL2</mark> DHL cell line with morphologic features of DLBCL that we have established, designated as RC.
METHODS: We used tissue culture techniques to establish the RC cell line from primary DLBCL cells.
We also utilized molecular and cellular biological techniques including flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA fingerprinting, reverse-phase protein array, conventional cytogenetics, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to characterize the RC cell line.
NSG-severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice were utilized as a model for xeno-transplantation of RC cells.
RESULTS: RC cells had the following immunophenotype: positive for <mark>CD10</mark>, <mark>CD19</mark>, <mark>CD20</mark>, <mark>CD22</mark>, <mark>CD38</mark>, <mark>CD43</mark>, <mark>CD44</mark>, and <mark>CD79b</mark> and negative for <mark>CD3</mark>, <mark>CD4</mark>, <mark>CD5</mark>, <mark>CD8</mark>, <mark>CD11c</mark>, <mark>CD14</mark>, <mark>CD30</mark>, <mark>CD56</mark>, and <mark>CD200</mark>, which was identical to the primary tumor cells.
Conventional cytogenetic analysis showed a t(2;8)(p12;q24.2) and t(14;18)(q32;q21.3), corresponding to <mark>MYC</mark> and <mark>BCL2</mark> gene rearrangements, respectively.
DNA fingerprinting authenticated the RC cell line to be of the same clone as the primary tumor cells.
In addition, RC cells were established in SCID mice as an in vivo model for translational therapeutics studies.
Proteomic analysis showed activation of the <mark>mTOR</mark> signaling pathway in RC cells that can be targeted with an <mark>mTOR</mark> inhibitor.
CONCLUSION: The data presented confirm the validity of the RC cell line as a representative model of <mark>MYC</mark>/<mark>BCL2</mark> DHL that will be useful for both in vitro and in vivo studies of DHL pathogenesis and therapeutics.
The mutational landscape of cutaneous T cell lymphoma and Sezary syndrome.
Sezary syndrome is a leukemic and aggressive form of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) resulting from the malignant transformation of skin-homing central memory <mark>CD4</mark>(+) T cells.
Here we performed whole-exome sequencing of tumor-normal sample pairs from 25 patients with Sezary syndrome and 17 patients with other CTCLs.
These analyses identified a distinctive pattern of somatic copy number alterations in Sezary syndrome, including highly prevalent chromosomal deletions involving the <mark>TP53</mark>, <mark>RB1</mark>, <mark>PTEN</mark>, <mark>DNMT3A</mark> and <mark>CDKN1B</mark> tumor suppressors.
Mutation analysis identified a broad spectrum of somatic mutations in key genes involved in epigenetic regulation (<mark>TET2</mark>, <mark>CREBBP</mark>, <mark>KMT2D</mark> (<mark>MLL2</mark>), <mark>KMT2C</mark> (<mark>MLL3</mark>), <mark>BRD9</mark>, <mark>SMARCA4</mark> and <mark>CHD3</mark>) and signaling, including <mark>MAPK1</mark>, <mark>BRAF</mark>, <mark>CARD11</mark> and <mark>PRKG1</mark> mutations driving increased <mark>MAPK</mark>, <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> and <mark>NFAT</mark> activity upon <mark>T cell receptor</mark> stimulation.
Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the genetics of Sezary syndrome and CTCL and support the development of personalized therapies targeting key oncogenically activated signaling pathways for the treatment of these diseases.
<mark>A-kinase anchor protein 4</mark> (<mark>AKAP4</mark>) a promising therapeutic target of colorectal cancer.
BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks third among the estimated cancer cases and cancer related mortalities in the Western world.
Early detection and efficient therapy of CRC remains a major health challenge.
Therefore, there is a need to identify novel tumor markers for early diagnosis and treatment of CRC.
METHODS: <mark>A-kinase anchor protein 4</mark> (<mark>AKAP4</mark>) gene and protein expression was monitored by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and Western blotting in normal colon tissue lysate, normal colon epithelial cells and in colon cancer cell lines viz., Caco-2, COLO205, COLO320DM, HCT-15, HCT116, HT-29, SW480, and SW620.
The effect of <mark>AKAP4</mark> on cellular growth, migration and invasion abilities was studied using gene silencing approach.
The role of <mark>AKAP4</mark> in various pathways involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, senescence was investigated in in vitro and in human xenograft mouse model.
RESULTS: Our studies showed that <mark>AKAP4</mark> gene and protein expression was expressed in all colon cancer cells while no expression was detectable in normal colon cells.
Ablation of <mark>AKAP4</mark> led to reduced cellular growth, migration, invasion and increased apoptosis and senescence of CRC cells in in vitro assays and tumor growth in human xenograft mouse.
Human colon xenograft studies showed a significant decrease in the levels of <mark>cyclins B1, D and E</mark> and <mark>cyclin dependent kinases</mark> such as <mark>CDK1</mark>, <mark>CDK2</mark>, <mark>CDK4</mark> and <mark>CDK6</mark>.
Interestingly, an up-regulation in the levels of <mark>p16</mark> and <mark>p21</mark> was also observed.
Besides, an increase in the levels of pro-apoptotic molecules <mark>AIF</mark>, <mark>APAF1</mark>, <mark>BAD</mark>, <mark>BID</mark>, <mark>BAK</mark>, <mark>BAX</mark>, <mark>PARP1</mark>, <mark>NOXA</mark>, <mark>PUMA</mark> and <mark>cyt-C</mark> and <mark>Caspase 3, 7, 8 and 9</mark> was also found in cancer cells as well as in xenograft tissue sections.
However, anti-apoptotic molecules <mark>BCL2</mark>, <mark>Bcl-xL</mark>, <mark>cIAP2</mark>, <mark>XIAP</mark>, <mark>Axin2</mark> and <mark>Survivin</mark> were down regulated in these samples.
Our data also revealed elevated expression of epithelial marker <mark>E-cadherin</mark> and down regulation of EMT markers <mark>N-cadherin</mark>, <mark>P-cadherin</mark>, <mark>SLUG</mark>, <mark>α-SMA</mark>, <mark>SNAIL</mark>, <mark>TWIST</mark> and <mark>Vimentin</mark>.
Further ablation of <mark>AKAP4</mark> resulted in the down regulation of invasion molecules <mark>matrix metalloproteinase</mark> <mark>MMP2</mark>, <mark>MMP3</mark> and <mark>MMP9</mark>.
CONCLUSION: <mark>AKAP4</mark> appears to be a novel CRC-associated antigen with a potential for developing as a new clinical therapeutic target.
DNA-damage response gene <mark>GADD45A</mark> induces differentiation in hematopoietic stem cells without inhibiting cell cycle or survival.
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain blood cell production life-long by their unique abilities of self-renewal and differentiation into all blood cell lineages.
<mark>Growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible 45 alpha</mark> (<mark>GADD45A</mark>) is induced by genotoxic stress in HSCs.
<mark>GADD45A</mark> has been implicated in cell cycle control, cell death and senescence, as well as in DNA-damage repair.
In general, <mark>GADD45A</mark> provides cellular stability by either arresting the cell cycle progression until DNA damage is repaired or, in cases of fatal damage, by inducing apoptosis.
However, the function of <mark>GADD45A</mark> in hematopoiesis remains controversial.
We revealed the changes in murine HSC fate control orchestrated by the expression of <mark>GADD45A</mark> at single cell resolution.
In contrast to other cellular systems, <mark>GADD45A</mark> expression did not cause a cell cycle arrest or an alteration in the decision between cell survival and apoptosis in HSCs.
Strikingly, <mark>GADD45A</mark> strongly induced and accelerated the differentiation program in HSCs.
Continuous tracking of individual HSCs and their progeny via time-lapse microscopy elucidated that once <mark>GADD45A</mark> was expressed, HSCs differentiate into committed progenitors within 29 hours.
<mark>GADD45A</mark>-expressing HSCs failed to long-term reconstitute the blood of recipients by inducing multilineage differentiation in vivo.
Importantly, γ-irradiation of HSCs induced their differentiation by upregulating endogenous <mark>GADD45A</mark>.
The differentiation induction by <mark>GADD45A</mark> was transmitted by activating <mark>p38 Mitogen-activated protein kinase</mark> (<mark>MAPK</mark>) signaling and allowed the generation of megakaryocytic-erythroid, myeloid, and lymphoid lineages.
These data indicate that genotoxic stress-induced <mark>GADD45A</mark> expression in HSCs prevents their fatal transformation by directing them into differentiation and thereby clearing them from the system.
RNA-seq analysis of impact of <mark>PNN</mark> on gene expression and alternative splicing in corneal epithelial cells.
PURPOSE: The specialized corneal epithelium requires differentiated properties, specific for its role at the anterior surface of the eye.
Thus, tight maintenance of the differentiated qualities of the corneal epithelial is essential.
<mark>Pinin</mark> (<mark>PNN</mark>) is an exon junction component (EJC) that has dramatic implications for corneal epithelial cell differentiation and may act as a stabilizer of the corneal epithelial cell phenotype.
Our studies revealed that <mark>PNN</mark> is involved in transcriptional repression complexes and spliceosomal complexes, placing <mark>PNN</mark> at the fulcrum between chromatin and mRNA splicing.
Transcriptome analysis of <mark>PNN</mark>-knockdown cells revealed clear and reproducible alterations in transcript profiles and splicing patterns of a subset of genes that would significantly impact the epithelial cell phenotype.
We further investigated <mark>PNN</mark>'s role in the regulation of gene expression and alternative splicing (AS) in a corneal epithelial context.
METHODS: Human corneal epithelial (HCET) cells that carry the doxycycline-inducible <mark>PNN</mark>-knockdown shRNA vector were used to perform RNA-seq to determine differential gene expression and differential AS events.
RESULTS: Multiple genes and AS events were identified as differentially expressed between <mark>PNN</mark>-knockdown and control cells.
Genes upregulated by <mark>PNN</mark> knockdown included a large proportion of genes that are associated with enhanced cell migration and ECM remodeling processes, such as <mark>MMPs</mark>, <mark>ADAMs</mark>, <mark>HAS2</mark>, <mark>LAMA3</mark>, <mark>CXCR</mark>s, and <mark>UNC5C</mark>.
Genes downregulated in response to <mark>PNN</mark> depletion included <mark>IGFBP5</mark>, <mark>FGD3</mark>, <mark>FGFR2</mark>, <mark>PAX6</mark>, <mark>RARG</mark>, and <mark>SOX10</mark>.
AS events in <mark>PNN</mark>-knockdown cells compared to control cells were also more likely to be detected, and upregulated.
In particular, 60% of exon-skipping events, detected in only one condition, were detected in <mark>PNN</mark>-knockdown cells and of the shared exon-skipping events, 92% of those differentially expressed were more frequent in the <mark>PNN</mark> knockdown.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that lowering of <mark>PNN</mark> levels in epithelial cells results in dramatic transformation in the number and composition of splicing variants and that <mark>PNN</mark> plays a crucial role in the selection of which RNA isoforms differentiating cells produce.
Many of the genes affected by <mark>PNN</mark> knockdown are known to affect the epithelial phenotype.
This window into the complexity of RNA splicing in the corneal epithelium implies that <mark>PNN</mark> exerts broad influence over the regulation and maintenance of the epithelial cell phenotype.
<mark>Serum Amyloid A</mark> Induces Inflammation, Proliferation and Cell Death in Activated Hepatic Stellate Cells.
<mark>Serum amyloid A</mark> (<mark>SAA</mark>) is an evolutionary highly conserved acute phase protein that is predominantly secreted by hepatocytes.
However, its role in liver injury and fibrogenesis has not been elucidated so far.
In this study, we determined the effects of <mark>SAA</mark> on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the main fibrogenic cell type of the liver.
<mark>Serum amyloid A</mark> potently activated <mark>IkappaB kinase</mark>, <mark>c-Jun N-terminal kinase</mark> (<mark>JNK</mark>), <mark>Erk</mark> and <mark>Akt</mark> and enhanced <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>-dependent luciferase activity in primary human and rat HSCs.
<mark>Serum amyloid A</mark> induced the transcription of <mark>MCP-1</mark>, <mark>RANTES</mark> and <mark>MMP9</mark> in an <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>- and <mark>JNK</mark>-dependent manner.
Blockade of <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> revealed cytotoxic effects of <mark>SAA</mark> in primary HSCs with signs of apoptosis such as <mark>caspase 3</mark> and <mark>PARP</mark> cleavage and <mark>Annexin V</mark> staining.
<mark>Serum amyloid A</mark> induced HSC proliferation, which depended on <mark>JNK</mark>, <mark>Erk</mark> and <mark>Akt</mark> activity.
In primary hepatocytes, <mark>SAA</mark> also activated <mark>MAP kinases,</mark> but did not induce relevant cell death after <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> inhibition.
In two models of hepatic fibrogenesis, CCl4 treatment and bile duct ligation, hepatic mRNA levels of <mark>SAA1</mark> and <mark>SAA3</mark> were strongly increased.
In conclusion, <mark>SAA</mark> may modulate fibrogenic responses in the liver in a positive and negative fashion by inducing inflammation, proliferation and cell death in HSCs.
The Innate Immune Receptor <mark>NLRX1</mark> Functions as a Tumor Suppressor by Reducing Colon Tumorigenesis and Key Tumor-Promoting Signals.
<mark>NOD-like receptor</mark> (<mark>NLR</mark>) proteins are intracellular innate immune sensors/receptors that regulate immunity.
This work shows that <mark>NLRX1</mark> serves as a tumor suppressor in colitis-associated cancer (CAC) and sporadic colon cancer by keeping key tumor promoting pathways in check.
<mark>Nlrx1</mark>(-/-) mice were highly susceptible to CAC, showing increases in key cancer-promoting pathways including <mark>nuclear factor κB</mark> (<mark>NF-κB</mark>), <mark>mitogen-activated protein kinase</mark> (<mark>MAPK</mark>), <mark>signal transducer and activator of transcription 3</mark> (<mark>STAT3</mark>), and <mark>interleukin 6</mark> (<mark>IL-6</mark>).
The tumor-suppressive function of <mark>NLRX1</mark> originated primarily from the non-hematopoietic compartment.
This prompted an analysis of <mark>NLRX1</mark> function in the <mark>Apc</mark>(min/+) genetic model of sporadic gastrointestinal cancer.
<mark>NLRX1</mark> attenuated <mark>Apc</mark>(min/+) colon tumorigenesis, cellular proliferation, <mark>NF-κB</mark>, <mark>MAPK</mark>, <mark>STAT3</mark> activation, and <mark>IL-6</mark> levels.
Application of anti-<mark>interleukin 6 receptor</mark> (<mark>IL6R</mark>) antibody therapy reduced tumor burden, increased survival, and reduced <mark>STAT3</mark> activation in <mark>Nlrx1</mark>(-/-)<mark>Apc</mark>(min/+) mice.
As an important clinical correlate, human colon cancer samples expressed lower levels of <mark>NLRX1</mark> than healthy controls in multiple patient cohorts.
These data implicate anti-<mark>IL6R</mark> as a potential personalized therapy for colon cancers with reduced <mark>NLRX1</mark>.
Circulating <mark>Fatty Acid Synthase</mark> in pregnant women: Relationship to blood pressure, maternal metabolism and newborn parameters.
The enzyme <mark>FASN</mark> (<mark>fatty acid synthase</mark>) is potentially related with hypertension and metabolic dysfunction.
<mark>FASN</mark> is highly expressed in the human placenta.
We aimed to investigate the relationship circulating <mark>FASN</mark> has with blood pressure, maternal metabolism and newborn parameters in healthy pregnant women.
Circulating <mark>FASN</mark> was assessed in 115 asymptomatic pregnant women in the second trimester of gestation along with C-peptide, fasting glucose and <mark>insulin</mark>, post-load glucose lipids, HMW-<mark>adiponectin</mark> and blood pressure (the latter was assessed in each trimester of gestation).
At birth, newborns and placentas were weighed.
<mark>FASN</mark> expression was also able to be assessed in 80 placentas.
Higher circulating <mark>FASN</mark> was associated with lower systolic blood pressure (SBP), with a more favourable metabolic phenotype (lower fasting glucose and <mark>insulin</mark>, post load glucose, <mark>HbAc1</mark>, HOMA-IR and C-peptide), and with lower placental and birth weight (all p < 0.05 to p < 0.001).
Placental <mark>FASN</mark> expression related positively to circulating <mark>FASN</mark> (p < 0.005) and negatively to placental weight (p < 0.05).
Our observations suggest a physiological role of placental <mark>FASN</mark> in human pregnancy.
Future studies will clarify whether circulating <mark>FASN</mark> of placental origin does actually regulate placental and fetal growth, and (thereby) has a favourable influence on the pregnant mother's <mark>insulin</mark> sensitivity and blood pressure.
<mark>High Mobility Group Box-1</mark> Promotes Inflammation-Induced Lymphangiogenesis via <mark>Toll-Like Receptor 4</mark>-Dependent Signalling Pathway.
Lymphangiogenesis in inflammation has received considerable attention in recent years.
Administration of modulating lymphangiogenesis provides more possibilities of treating inflammation-associated diseases.
However, the main mediators and factors governing inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis (ILA) are yet to be defined.
Here, we explored the role of <mark>HMGB1</mark>-<mark>TLR4</mark> signalling pathway in modulating inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis and its underlying mechanisms using an ILA mouse model and 2 cell lines.
Our results show that <mark>HMGB1</mark> promoted <mark>VEGF-C</mark>-induced HDLECs proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and <mark>TLR4</mark> mediates <mark>HMGB1</mark>-induced LECs proliferation and tube formation in vitro.
And in vivo, r<mark>HMGB1</mark> treatment significantly promoted ILA, and the promoting effects was inhibited notably when <mark>HMGB1</mark>-<mark>TLR4</mark> was blocked.
<mark>HMGB1</mark>-associated ILA is primarily dependent on <mark>TLR4</mark> but not on <mark>TLR2</mark>.
In mechanisms, the recruitment and activation of <mark>CD11b</mark>+ cells are important cellular mechanisms in <mark>HMGB1</mark>-<mark>TLR4</mark> associated ILA, and multiple key pro-lymphangiogenesis molecules mediates <mark>HMGB1</mark>-<mark>TLR4</mark> associated ILA, including <mark>VEGF-C</mark>/<mark>VEGFR3</mark>, inflammatory factors <mark>IL-1β</mark> and <mark>TNF-α</mark>, <mark>MMP-2</mark> and <mark>MMP-9</mark> and <mark>NF-κB p65</ma<mark>p65</mark>.
In conclusion, <mark>HMGB1</mark>-associated ILA is primarily dependent on <mark>TLR4</mark>, and <mark>CD11b</mark>+ cells and multiple molecular mechanisms mediate <mark>HMGB1</mark>-<mark>TLR4</mark> associated ILA.
Furthermore, the ILA can be effectively modulated by <mark>HMGB1</mark>-<mark>TLR4</mark> signalling.
Consequently, administration of modulating ILA through <mark>HMGB1</mark>-<mark>TLR4</mark> pathway may provide us more possibilities of treating inflammation and lymphangiogenesis associated diseases.
Repurposing an orally available drug for the treatment of geographic atrophy.
PURPOSE: Chronic oxidative stress and subacute inflammation have been implicated as causes of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
In this study, we tested whether an orally available <mark>5-OH-tryptamine (5HT) 1a receptor</mark> agonist, xaliproden, could protect against retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell damage in culture and in a mouse model of geographic atrophy.
METHODS: Paraquat was used to create mitochondrial oxidative stress in ARPE-19 cells, and <mark>tumor necrosis factor-a</mark> (<mark>TNF-a</mark>) was used to stimulate the production of inflammatory <mark>cytokines</mark> in these cells.
The production of antioxidant proteins, <mark>metallothionein</mark>, and inflammatory <mark>cytokines</mark> was assayed with quantitative real-time PCR.
Cell survival was analyzed with microscopy and a cell titer assay.
Integrity of the RPE monolayer was determined by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and with immunocytochemistry with <mark>zona occludens protein 1</mark> (<mark>ZO-1</mark>) antibody.
RPE atrophy was studied in mice deleted for <mark>Sod2</mark> (the gene for <mark>mitochondrial superoxide dismutase</mark>) specifically in the RPE.
The mice were treated orally with daily doses of xaliproden at 0.5 and 3 mg/kg for 4 months.
The retinal structure was analyzed with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and with light and electron microscopy.
Retinal function was assessed with full-field electroretinography (ERG) and with optokinetic measurements.
RESULTS: Xaliproden led to a dose-dependent increase in cell survival following treatment with paraquat.
Synthesis of the antioxidant response genes <mark>NqO1</mark>, <mark>GSTM1</mark>, <mark>CAT</mark>, <mark>HO-1</mark>, and <mark>Nrf2</mark> was increased in response to the drug, as was the zinc chaperone <mark>metallothionein</mark>.
Treatment of cells with <mark>TNF-a</mark> led to increased production of <mark>IL-1b</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20</mark> (<mark>CCL20</mark>), and <mark>vascular endothelial growth factor</mark> (<mark>VEGF</mark>) by ARPE-19 cells, and this response was attenuated by treatment with xaliproden.
<mark>TNF-a</mark> also led to a decrease in the TEER that was prevented by treatment with the <mark>5HT1a</mark> agonist.
Daily gavage with xaliproden at either dose induced the production of protective enzymes in the mouse retina, and treatment of the <mark>Sod2</mark>-deleted mice with the drug showed improved thickness of the outer nuclear layer and improved visual acuity relative to the control-treated mice.
There was no significant difference in full-field scotopic ERG among the treatment groups, however.
Vacuolization of the RPE and disorganization of the photoreceptor outer segments were reduced at both dose levels of xaliproden.
CONCLUSIONS: Xaliproden protected RPE cells from oxidative and inflammatory insults and protected the mouse RPE and retina from RPE atrophy in the face of excess mitochondrial oxidative stress.
These results suggest that this drug, which had a reasonable safety profile in clinical trials, may be used to prevent the progression of geographic atrophy in humans.
<mark>Hsp90beta</mark> is involved in the development of high salt-diet-induced nephropathy via interaction with various signalling proteins.
A high-salt diet often leads to a local intrarenal increase in renal hypoxia and oxidative stress, which are responsible for an excess production of pathogenic substances.
Here, Wistar Kyoto/spontaneous hypertensive (WKY/SHR) rats fed a high-salt diet developed severe proteinuria, resulting from pronounced renal inflammation, fibrosis and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis.
All these were mainly non-pressure-related effects.
<mark>Hsp90beta</mark>, <mark>TGF-beta,</mark> <mark>HIF-1alpha</mark>, <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark> and <mark>MCP-1</mark> were shown to be highly expressed in response to salt loading.
Next, we found that <mark>Hsp90beta</mark> might play the key role in non-pressure-related effects of salt loading through a series of cellular signalling events, including the <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>, <mark>p38</mark> activation and <mark>Bcl-2</mark> inactivation.
<mark>Hsp90beta</mark> was previously proven to regulate the upstream mediators in multiple cellular signalling cascades through stabilizing and maintaining their activities.
In our study, 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) or <mark>Hsp90beta</mark> knockdown dramatically alleviated the high-salt-diet-induced proteinuria and renal damage without altering blood pressure significantly, when it reversed activations of <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>, <mark>mTOR</mark> and <mark>p38</mark> signalling cascades.
Meanwhile, Co-IP results demonstrated that <mark>Hsp90beta</mark> could interact with and stabilize <mark>TAK1</mark>, <mark>AMPKalpha</mark>, <mark>IKKalpha/beta</mark>, <mark>HIF-1alpha</mark> and <mark>Raptor</mark>, whereas <mark>Hsp90beta</mark> inhibition disrupted this process.
In addition, <mark>Hsp90beta</mark> inhibition-mediated renal improvements also accompanied the reduction of renal oxidative stress.
In conclusion, salt loading indeed exhibited non-pressure-related impacts on proteinuria and renal dysfunction in WKY/SHR rats.
<mark>Hsp90beta</mark> inhibition caused the destabilization of upstream mediators in various pathogenic signalling events, thereby effectively ameliorating this nephropathy owing to renal hypoxia and oxidative stress.
Negative Selection and Chromosome Instability Induced by <mark>Mad2</mark> Overexpression Delay Breast Cancer but Facilitate Oncogene-Independent Outgrowth.
Chromosome instability (CIN) is associated with poor survival and therapeutic outcome in a number of malignancies.
Despite this correlation, CIN can also lead to growth disadvantages.
Here, we show that simultaneous overexpression of the mitotic checkpoint protein <mark>Mad2</mark> with <mark>Kras</mark>(<mark>G12D</mark>) or <mark>Her2</mark> in mammary glands of adult mice results in mitotic checkpoint overactivation and a delay in tumor onset.
Time-lapse imaging of organotypic cultures and pathologic analysis prior to tumor establishment reveals error-prone mitosis, mitotic arrest, and cell death.
Nonetheless, <mark>Mad2</mark> expression persists and increases karyotype complexity in <mark>Kras</mark> tumors.
Faced with the selective pressure of oncogene withdrawal, <mark>Mad2</mark>-positive tumors have a higher frequency of developing persistent subclones that avoid remission and continue to grow.
Deregulation of <mark>polycom<mark>polycomb repressor complex 1</mark>er</mark> <mark>AUTS2</mark> in T-cell leukemia.
Recently, we identified deregulated expression of the B-cell specific transcription factor <mark>MEF2C</mark> in T-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (T-ALL).
Here, we performed sequence analysis of a regulatory upstream section of <mark>MEF2C</mark> in T-ALL cell lines which, however, proved devoid of mutations.
Unexpectedly, we found strong conservation between the regulatory upstream region of <mark>MEF2C</mark> (located at chromosomal band 5q14) and an intergenic stretch at 7q11 located between <mark>STAG3L4</mark> and <mark>AUTS2</mark>, covering nearly 20 kb.
While the non-coding gene <mark>STAG3L4</mark> was inconspicuously expressed, <mark>AUTS2</mark> was aberrantly upregulated in 6% of T-ALL patients (public dataset GSE42038) and in 3/24 T-ALL cell lines, two of which represented very immature differentiation stages.
<mark>AUTS2</mark> expression was higher in normal B-cells than in T-cells, indicating lineage-specific activity in lymphopoiesis.
While excluding chromosomal aberrations, examinations of <mark>AUTS2</mark> transcriptional regulation in T-ALL cells revealed activation by <mark>IL7</mark>-<mark>IL7R</mark>-<mark>STAT5</mark>-signalling and <mark>MEF2C</mark>.
<mark>AUTS2</mark> protein has been shown to interact with <mark>polycomb repressor complex 1 subtype 5</mark> (<mark>PRC1.5</mark>), transforming this particular complex into an activator.
Accordingly, expression profiling and functional analyses demonstrated that <mark>AUTS2</mark> activated while <mark>PCGF5</mark> repressed transcription of NKL homeobox gene <mark>MSX1</mark> in T-ALL cells.
Forced expression and pharmacological inhibition of <mark>EZH2</mark> in addition to H3K27me3 analysis indicated that <mark>PRC2</mark> repressed
<mark>MSX1</mark> as well.
Taken together, we found that <mark>AUTS2</mark> and <mark>MEF2C</mark>, de<mark>s</mark>pite lying on different chromosomes, share strikingly similar regulatory upstream regions and aberrant expression in T-ALL subsets.
Our data implicate chromatin complexes <mark>PRC1</mark>/<mark>AUTS2</mark> and <mark>PRC2</mark> in a gene network in T-ALL regulating early lymphoid differentiation.
<mark>MiR-204</mark> silencing in intraepithelial to invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma progression.
BACKGROUND: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common skin cancer and frequently progresses from an actinic keratosis (AK), a sun-induced keratinocyte intraepithelial neoplasia (KIN).
Epigenetic mechanisms involved in the phenomenon of progression from AK to cSCC remain to be elicited.
METHODS: Expression of microRNAs in sun-exposed skin, AK and cSCC was analysed by Agilent microarrays.
DNA methylation of <mark>miR-204</mark> promoter was determined by bisulphite treatment and pyrosequencing.
Identification of <mark>miR-204</mark> targets and pathways was accomplished in HaCat cells.
Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze <mark>STAT3</mark> activation and <mark>PTPN11</mark> expression in human biopsies.
RESULTS: cSCCs display a marked downregulation of <mark>miR-204</mark> expression when compared to AK.
DNA methylation of <mark>miR-204</mark> promoter was identified as one of the repressive mechanisms that accounts for <mark>miR-204</mark> silencing in cSCC.
In HaCaT cells <mark>miR-204</mark> inhibits <mark>STAT3</mark> and favours the <mark>MAPK</mark> signaling pathway, likely acting through <mark>PTPN11</mark>, a nuclear <mark>tyrosine phosphatase</mark> that is a direct <mark>miR-204</mark> target.
In non-peritumoral AK lesions, activated <mark>STAT3</mark>, as detected by pY705-<mark>STAT3</mark> immunofluorescence, is retained in the membrane and cytoplasm compartments, whereas AK lesions adjacent to cSCCs display activated <mark>STAT3</mark> in the nuclei.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that <mark>miR-204</mark> may act as a "rheostat" that controls the signalling towards the <mark>MAPK</mark> pathway or the <mark>STAT3</mark> pathway in the progression from AK to cSCC.
Gartanin induces cell cycle arrest and autophagy and suppresses migration involving <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark> and <mark>MAPK</mark> signalling pathway in human glioma cells.
In central nervous system, glioma is the most common primary brain tumour.
The diffuse migration and rapid proliferation are main obstacles for successful treatment.
Gartanin, a natural xanthone of mangosteen, suppressed proliferation, migration and colony formation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in T98G glioma cells but not in mouse normal neuronal HT22 cells.
Gartanin, at low micromole, led to cell cycle arrest in G1 phase accompanied by inhibited expression level of G1 cell cycle regulatory proteins <mark>cyclin D1</mark>, while increased expression level of <mark>cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor</mark> <mark>p27Kip1</mark>.
In addition, the secretion and activity of <mark>matrix metalloproteinases 2/9</mark> (<mark>MMP-2/-9</mark>) were significantly suppressed in T98G cells treated with gartanin, and it might result from modulating <mark>mitogen-activated protein kinases</mark> (<mark>MAPK</mark>) signalling pathway in T98G glioma cells.
Moreover, gartanin significantly induced autophagy in T98G cells and increased GFP-<mark>LC3</mark> punctate fluorescence accompanied by the increased expression level of <mark>Beclin 1</mark> and <mark>LC3</mark>-II, while suppressed expression level of <mark>p62</mark>.
Gartanin treatment resulted in obvious inhibition of <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark> signalling pathway, which is important in modulating autophagy.
Notably, gartanin-mediated anti-viability was significantly abrogated by autophagy inhibitors including 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine (CQ).
These results indicate that anti-proliferation effect of gartanin in T98G cells is most likely via cell cycle arrest modulated by autophagy, which is regulated by <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark> signalling pathway, while anti-migration effect is most likely via suppression of <mark>MMP-2/-9</mark> activity which is involved in <mark>MAPK</mark> signalling pathway.
DDA suppresses angiogenesis and tumor growth of colorectal cancer in vivo through decreasing <mark>VEGFR2</mark> signaling.
As angiogenesis is required for tumor growth and metastasis, suppressing angiogenesis is a promising strategy in limiting tumor progression.
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, a critical pro-angiogenic factor, has thus become an attractive target for therapeutic interventions in cancer.
In this study, we explored the underlying mechanisms of a novel anthraquinone derivative DDA in suppressing angiogenesis.
DDA inhibited VEGF-A-induced proliferation, migration and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
DDA also reduced VEGF-A-induced microvessel sprouting from aortic rings ex vivo and suppressed neovascularization in vivo.
VEGF-A-induced <mark>VEGFR1</mark>, <mark>VEGFR2</mark>, <mark>FAK</mark>, <mark>Akt</mark>, <mark>ERK1/2</mark> or <mark>STAT3</mark> phosphorylation was reduced in the presence of DDA.
In addition, <mark>NRP-1</mark> siRNA reduced VEGF-A's enhancing effects in <mark>VEGFR2</mark>, <mark>FAK</mark> and <mark>Akt</mark> phosphorylation and cell proliferation in HUVECs.
DDA disrupted VEGF-A-induced complex formation between <mark>NRP-1</mark> and <mark>VEGFR2</mark>.
Furthermore, systemic administration of DDA was shown to suppress tumor angiogenesis and growth in in vivo mouse xenograft models.
Taken together, we demonstrated in this study that DDA exhibits anti-angiogenic properties through suppressing <mark>VEGF-A</mark> signaling.
These observations also suggest that DDA might be a potential drug candidate for developing anti-angiogenic agent in the field of cancer and angiogenesis-related diseases.
<mark>MXRA5</mark> is a <mark>TGF-b1</mark>-regulated human protein with anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties.
Current therapy for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unsatisfactory because of an insufficient understanding of its pathogenesis.
<mark>Matrix remodelling-associated protein 5</mark> (<mark>MXRA5</mark>, <mark>adlican</mark>) is a human protein of unknown function with high kidney tissue expression, not present in rodents.
Given the increased expression of <mark>MXRA5</mark> in injured tissues, including the kidneys, we have suggested that <mark>MXRA5</mark> may modulate kidney injury.
<mark>MXRA5</mark> immunoreactivity was observed in tubular cells in human renal biopsies and in urine from CKD patients.
We then explored factors regulating <mark>MXRA5</mark> expression and <mark>MXRA5</mark> function in cultured human proximal tubular epithelial cells and explored <mark>MXRA5</mark> expression in kidney cancer cells and kidney tissue.
The fibrogenic cytokine <mark>transforming growth factor-β1</mark> (<mark>TGFb1</mark>) up-regulated <mark>MXRA5</mark> mRNA and protein expression.
<mark>TGFb1</mark>-induced <mark>MXRA5</mark> up-regulation was prevented by either interference with <mark>TGFb1</mark> activation of the <mark>TGFb receptor 1</mark> (<mark>TGFBR1</mark>, <mark>ALK5</mark>) or by the <mark>vitamin D receptor</mark> agonist paricalcitol.
By contrast, the pro-inflammatory cytokine <mark>TWEAK</mark> did not modulate <mark>MXRA5</mark> expression.
<mark>MXRA5</mark> siRNA-induced down-regulation of constitutive <mark>MXRA5</mark> expression resulted in higher <mark>TWEAK</mark>-induced expression of chemokines.
In addition, <mark>MXRA5</mark> down-regulation resulted in a magnified expression of genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins in response to <mark>TGFb1</mark>.
Furthermore, in clear cell renal cancer, <mark>von Hippel-Lindau</mark> (<mark>VHL</mark>) regulated <mark>MXRA5</mark> expression.
In conclusion, <mark>MXRA5</mark> is a <mark>TGFb1</mark>- and <mark>VHL</mark>-regulated protein and, for the first time, we identify <mark>MXRA5</mark> functions as an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic molecule.
This information may yield clues to design novel therapeutic strategies in diseases characterized by inflammation and fibrosis.
Prognostic and therapeutic value of mitochondrial <mark>serine hydroxyl-methyltransferase 2</mark> as a breast cancer biomarker.
Mitochondrial <mark>serine hydroxylmethyltransferase 2</mark> (<mark>SHMT2</mark>) is a key enzyme in the serine/glycine synthesis pathway.
<mark>SHMT2</mark> has been implicated as a critical component for tumor cell survival.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic value and efficiency of <mark>SHMT2</mark> as a biomarker in patients with breast cancer.
Individual and pooled survival analyses were performed on five independent breast cancer microarray datasets.
Gene signatures enriched by <mark>SHMT2</mark> were also analyzed in these datasets.
<mark>SHMT2</mark> protein expression was detected using immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay in 128 breast cancer cases.
Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that <mark>SHMT2</mark> was significantly associated with gene signatures of mitochondrial module, cancer invasion, metastasis and poor survival among breast cancer patients (p<0.05).
The clinical relevance of <mark>SHMT2</mark> was validated on IHC data.
The mitochondrial localization of <mark>SHMT2</mark> protein was visualized on IHC staining.
Independent and pooled analysis confirmed that <mark>SHMT2</mark> expression was associated with breast cancer tumor aggressiveness (<mark>TNM</mark> staging and Elson grade) in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05).
The prognostic performance of <mark>SHMT2</mark> mRNA was comparable to other gene signatures and proved superior to <mark>TNM</mark> staging.
Further analysis results indicated that <mark>SHMT2</mark> had better prognostic value for <mark>estrogen receptor</mark> (<mark>ER</mark>)-negative breast cancer patients, compared to <mark>ER</mark>-positive patients.
In cases involving stage IIb breast cancer, chemotherapy significantly extended survival time among patients with high <mark>SHMT2</mark> expression.
These results indicate that <mark>SHMT2</mark> may be a valuable prognostic biomarker in <mark>ER</mark>-negative breast cancer cases.
Furthermore, <mark>SHMT2</mark> may be a potential target for breast cancer treatment and drug discovery.
Regulation of <mark>GPCR</mark> expression through an interaction with <mark>CCT7</mark>, a subunit of the <mark>CCT</mark>/<mark>TRiC</mark> complex.
Mechanisms that prevent aggregation and promote folding of nascent <mark>G protein-coupled receptors</mark> (<mark>GPCRs</mark>) remain poorly understood.
We identified chaperonin containing <mark>TCP-1</mark> subunit eta (<mark>CCT7</mark>) as an interacting partner of the <mark>β-isoform of thrombo<mark>thromboxane A2 receptor</mark> (<mark>TPβ</mark>) by yeast two-hybrid screening.
<mark>CCT7</mark> coimmunoprecipitated with overexpressed <mark>TPβ</mark> and <mark>β2-adrenergic receptor</mark> (<mark>β2AR</mark>) in HEK 293 cells, but also with endogenous <mark>β2AR</mark>.
<mark>CCT7</mark> depletion by small interfering RNA reduced total and cell-surface expression of both receptors and caused redistribution of the receptors to juxtanuclear aggresomes, significantly more so for <mark>TPβ</mark> than <mark>β2AR</mark>.
Interestingly, <mark>Hsp90</mark> coimmunoprecipitated with <mark>β2AR</mark> but virtually not with <mark>TPβ</mark>, indicating that nascent <mark>GPCRs</mark> can adopt alternative folding pathways.
In vitro pull-down assays showed that both receptors can interact directly with <mark>CCT7</mark> through their third intracellular loops and C-termini.
We demonstrate that Trp(334) in the <mark>TPβ</mark> C-terminus is critical for the <mark>CCT7</mark> interaction and plays an important role in <mark>TPβ</mark> maturation and cell-surface expression.
Of note, introducing a tryptophan in the corresponding position of the <mark>TPα</mark> isoform confers the <mark>CCT7</mark>-binding and maturation properties of <mark>TPβ</mark>.
We show that an interaction with a subunit of the <mark>CCT</mark>/<mark>TCP-1</mark> ring complex (<mark>TRiC</mark>) chaperonin complex is involved in regulating aggregation of nascent <mark>GPCRs</mark> and in promoting their proper maturation and expression.
<mark>Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIβ</mark> negatively regulates invadopodia formation and suppresses an invasive cellular phenotype.
The <mark>type II phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase</mark> (<mark>PI4KII</mark>) enzymes synthesize the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P), which has been detected at the Golgi complex and endosomal compartments and recruits clathrin adaptors.
Despite common mechanistic similarities between the isoforms, the extent of their redundancy is unclear.
We found that depletion of <mark>PI4KIIα</mark> and <mark>PI4KIIβ</mark> using small interfering RNA led to actin remodeling.
Depletion of <mark>PI4KIIβ</mark> also induced the formation of invadopodia containing <mark>membrane type I matrix metalloproteinase</mark> (<mark>MT1-MMP</mark>).
Depletion of <mark>PI4KII</mark> isoforms also differentially affected trans-Golgi network (TGN) pools of PI(4)P and post-TGN traffic.
<mark>PI4KIIβ</mark> depletion caused increased <mark>MT1-MMP</mark> trafficking to invasive structures at the plasma membrane and was accompanied by reduced colocalization of <mark>MT1-MMP</mark> with membranes containing the endosomal markers <mark>Rab5</mark> and <mark>Rab7</mark> but increased localization with the exocytic <mark>Rab8</mark>.
Depletion of <mark>PI4KIIβ</mark> was sufficient to confer an aggressive invasive phenotype on minimally invasive HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines.
Mining oncogenomic databases revealed that loss of the <mark>PI4K2B</mark> allele and underexpression of <mark>PI4KIIβ</mark> mRNA are associated with human cancers.
This finding supports the cell data and suggests that <mark>PI4KIIβ</mark> may be a clinically significant suppressor of invasion.
We propose that <mark>PI4KIIβ</mark> synthesizes a pool of PI(4)P that maintains <mark>MT1-MMP</mark> traffic in the degradative pathway and suppresses the formation of invadopodia.
Sildenafil attenuates hypoxic pulmonary remodelling by inhibiting bone marrow progenitor cells.
The recruitment of bone marrow (BM)-derived progenitor cells to the lung is related to pulmonary remodelling and the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension (PH).
Although sildenafil is a known target in PH treatment, the underlying molecular mechanism is still elusive.
To test the hypothesis that the therapeutic effect of sildenafil is linked to the reduced recruitment of BM-derived progenitor cells, we induced pulmonary remodelling in rats by two-week exposure to chronic hypoxia (CH, 10% oxygen), a trigger of BM-derived progenitor cells.
Rats were treated with either placebo (saline) or sildenafil (1.4 mg/kg/day ip) during CH.
Control rats were kept in room air (21% oxygen) with no treatment.
As expected, sildenafil attenuated the CH-induced increase in right ventricular systolic pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy.
However, sildenafil suppressed the CH-induced increase in <mark>c-kit</mark>(+) cells in the adventitia of pulmonary arteries.
Moreover, sildenafil reduced the number of <mark>c-kit</mark>(+) cells that colocalize with <mark>tyrosine kinase receptor 2</mark> (<mark>VEGF-R2</mark>) and <mark>CD68</mark> (a marker for macrophages), indicating a positive effect on moderating hypoxia-induced smooth muscle cell proliferation and inflammation without affecting the pulmonary levels of <mark>hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α</mark>.
Furthermore, sildenafil depressed the number of <mark>CXCR4</mark>(+) cells.
Collectively, these findings indicate that the improvement in pulmonary haemodynamic by sildenafil is linked to decreased recruitment of BM-derived <mark>c-kit</mark>(+) cells in the pulmonary tissue.
The attenuation of the recruitment of BM-derived <mark>c-kit</mark>(+) cells by sildenafil may provide novel therapeutic insights into the control of pulmonary remodelling.
<mark>Tryptophan hydroxylase 1</mark> and <mark>5-HT7 receptor</mark> preferentially expressed in triple-negative breast cancer promote cancer progression through autocrine serotonin signaling.
BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a high risk of relapse and there are few chemotherapy options.
Although 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) signaling pathways have been suggested as potential targets for anti-cancer drug development, the mechanism responsible for the action of 5-HT in TNBC remains unknown.
METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to measure mRNA and protein levels, respectively.
Cell proliferation was measured using CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution.
siRNA transfection was used to assess involvement of genes in cancer invasion, which were identified by Matrigel transwell invasion assay.
Levels of 5-HT and <mark>vascular endothelial growth factor</mark> (<mark>VEGF</mark>) were measured using ELISA kits.
Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and mouse tumor model were used to investigate the in vivo effects of SB269970, a <mark>5-HT7 receptor</mark> antagonist, and BJ-1113, a novel synthetic compound.
RESULTS: TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, HCC-1395, and Hs578T) expressed higher levels of <mark>tryptophan hydroxylase 1</mark> (<mark>TPH1</mark>) than hormone-responsive breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T47D).
In MDA-MB-231 cells, 5-HT promoted invasion and proliferation via <mark>5-HT7 receptor</mark>, and interestingly, the stimulatory effect of 5-HT on MDA-MB-231 cell invasion was stronger than its effect on proliferation.
Likewise, downstream signaling pathways of 5-HT7 differed during invasion and proliferation, that is, <mark>Gα</mark>-activated cAMP and <mark>Gβγ</mark>-activated <mark>kinase</mark> signaling during invasion, and <mark>Gβγ</mark>-activated <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> signaling during proliferation.
Also, 5-HT increased the protein expressions of <mark>TPH1</mark> and <mark>VEGF</mark> in MDA-MB-231 cells.
These results provide insight of the stimulatory effect of 5-HT on breast cancer progression; 5-HT was found to act more strongly during the first stage of metastasis (during invasion and migration) than during the later proliferative phase after local invasion.
Interestingly, these actions of 5-HT were inhibited by BJ-1113, a 6-amino-2,4,5-trimethylpyridin-3-ol analog.
BJ-1113 blocked intracellular signaling pathways initiated by <mark>5-HT7 receptor</mark> activation, and exhibited anti-proliferative and anti-invasive activities against MDA-MB-231 cells.
Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of BJ-1113 against MDA-MB-231 tumor growth was greater than that of SB269970, a <mark>5-HT7 receptor</mark> antagonist.
CONCLUSIONS: <mark>5-HT7 receptor</mark> which mediates 5-HT-induced cancer progression is a potential therapeutic target in TNBC, and BJ-1113 offers a novel scaffold for the development of anti-cancer agents against TNBC.
<mark>Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1</mark>(<mark>VDAC1</mark>) Participates the Apoptosis of the Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Desminopathy.
Desminopathies caused by the mutation in the gene coding for <mark>desmin</mark> are genetically protein aggregation myopathies.
Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of pathological changes in the desminopathies at the earliest stage.
The molecular mechanisms of mitochondria dysfunction in desminopathies remain exclusive.
<mark>VDAC1</mark> regulates mitochondrial uptake across the outer membrane and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP).
Relationships between desminopathies and <mark>Voltage-dependent anion channel 1</mark> (<mark>VDAC1</mark>) remain unclear.
Here we successfully constructed the desminopathy rat model, evaluated with conventional stains, containing hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Gomori Trichrome (MGT), (PAS), red oil (ORO), NADH-TR, SDH staining and immunohistochemistry.
Immunofluorescence results showed that <mark>VDAC1</mark> was accumulated in the <mark>desmin</mark> highly stained area of muscle fibers of desminopathy patients or desminopathy rat model compared to the normal ones.
Meanwhile apoptosis related proteins <mark>bax</mark> and <mark>ATF2</mark> were involved in desminopathy patients and desminopathy rat model, but not <mark>bcl-2</mark>, <mark>bcl-xl</mark> or <mark>HK2</mark>.<mark>VDAC1</mark> and <mark>desmin</mark> are closely relevant in the tissue splices of deminopathies patients and rats with desminopathy at protein lever.
Moreover, apoptotic proteins are also involved in the desminopathies, like <mark>bax</mark>, <mark>ATF2</mark>, but not <mark>bcl-2</mark>, <mark>bcl-xl</mark> or <mark>HK2</mark>.
This pathological analysis presents the correlation between <mark>VDAC1</mark> and <mark>desmin</mark>, and apoptosis related proteins are correlated in the desminopathy.
Furthermore, we provide a rat model of desminopathy for the investigation of <mark>desmin</mark> related myopathy.
<mark>Bach1</mark> siRNA attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis by modulating oxidative stress in mice.
Oxidative stress plays an essential role in inflammation and fibrosis.
<mark>Bach1</mark> is an important transcriptional repressor that acts by modulating oxidative stress and represents a potential target in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis (PF).
In this study, we knocked down <mark>Bach1</mark> using adenovirus-mediated small interfering RNA (siRNA) to determine whether the use of <mark>Bach1</mark> siRNA is an effective therapeutic strategy in mice with bleomycin (BLM)‑induced PF.
Mouse lung fibroblasts (MLFs) were incubated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 (5 ng/ml) and subsequently infected with recombined adenovirus-like <mark>Bach1</mark> siRNA1 and <mark>Bach1</mark> siRNA2, while an empty adenovirus vector was used as the negative control.
The selected <mark>Bach1</mark> siRNA with higher interference efficiency was used for the animal experiments.
A mouse model of BLM-induced PF was established, and <mark>Bach1</mark> siRNA (1x109 pfu) was administered to the mice via the tail vein.
The results revealed that the <mark>Bach1</mark> mRNA and protein levels were significantly downregulated by <mark>Bach1</mark> siRNA.
Furthermore, the MLFs infected with <mark>Bach1</mark> siRNA exhibited increased mRNA and protein expression levels of <mark>heme oxygenase-1</mark> and <mark>glutathione peroxidase 1</mark>, but decreased levels of <mark>TGF-b1</mark> and <mark>interleukin-6</mark> in the cell supernatants compared with the cells exposed to TGF-β1 alone.
<mark>Bach1</mark> knockdown by siRNA also enhanced the expression of antioxidant factors, but suppressed that of fibrosis‑related cytokines in mice compared with the BLM group.
Finally, the inflammatory infiltration of alveolar and interstitial cells and the destruction of lung structure were significantly attenuated in the mide administered <mark>Bach1</mark> siRNA compared with those in the BLM group.
On the whole, our findings demonstrate that <mark>Bach1</mark> siRNA exerts protective effects against BLM-induced PF in mice.
Our data may provide the basis for the development of novel targeted therapeutic strategies for PF.
Spirulina lipopolysaccharides inhibit tumor growth in a <mark>Toll-like receptor 4</mark>-dependent manner by altering the <mark>cytokine</mark> milieu from <mark>interleukin-17</mark>/<mark>interleukin-23</mark> to <mark>interferon-γ</mark>.
Th17 cells and the <mark>cytokine</mark> they produce, <mark>interleukin (IL)-17</mark>, play an important role in tumor progression in humans and in mice.
<mark>IL-6</mark> and <mark>IL-23</mark> are critical <mark>cytokines</mark> for the differentiation and propagation of Th17 cells, respectively.
Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are known to stimulate immune cells to produce such inflammatory <mark>cytokines</mark>.
Contrary to Escherichia coli (E. coli) LPS, LPS from Spirulina has low toxicity and barely induces in vivo production of <mark>IL-6</mark> and <mark>IL-23</mark> in mice.
We examined the antitumor effects of Spirulina LPS compared to E. coli LPS in an MH134 hepatoma model.
Administration of Spirulina LPS suppressed tumor growth in C3H/HeN mice, but not in <mark>Toll-like receptor 4</mark> (<mark>TLR4</mark>)-mutant C3H/HeJ mice, by reducing serum levels of <mark>IL-17</mark> and <mark>IL-23</mark>, while increasing <mark>interferon (IFN)-γ</mark> levels.
The antitumor activity and <mark>IFN-γ</mark> production were mediated by T cells.
Moreover, in vitro experiments showed that Spirulina LPS impaired the antigen-presenting function that supports the generation of <mark>IL-17</mark>-producing cells in a <mark>toll-like receptor (TLR)4</mark>-dependent manner.
Of note, injection of anti-<mark>IL-17</mark> antibody in tumor-bearing C3H/HeN mice in the absence of Spirulina LPS markedly suppressed tumor growth and augmented <mark>IFN-γ</mark> responses.
Thus, our results support the notion that <mark>IFN-γ</mark> and <mark>IL-17</mark>/<mark>IL-23</mark> mutually regulate Th17 and Th1 responses in tumor-bearing hosts, and Spirulina LPS modulates the balance of the <mark>IFN-γ</mark>-<mark>IL-17</mark>/<mark>IL-23</mark> axis towards <mark>IFN-γ</mark> production, which leads to tumor inhibition.
Furthermore, Spirulina LPS effectively inhibited the spontaneous development of mammary tumors.
This study has important implications for the exploitation of TLR-based immunomodulators for cancer immunotherapy.
<mark>NEK2</mark> serves as a prognostic biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma.
<mark>Never in mitosis gene A (NIMA)-related kinase 2</mark> (<mark>NEK2</mark>) is a <mark>microtubule-associated protein</mark> that regulates spindle assembly in human cells and is overexpressed in various malignancies.
However, the role of <mark>NEK2</mark> in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains undetermined.
We performed RNA-seq of the HCC cell line SMMC-7721 and the normal liver cell line HL-7702 using the Ion Proton System.
<mark>NEK2</mark> expression was detected using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in two cell lines and 5 matched HCC and adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues.
The correlation between survival and <mark>NEK2</mark> expression was analyzed in 359 patients with HCC using RNASeqV2 data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) website (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/).
The expression of <mark>NEK2</mark>, phospho-<mark>AKT</mark> and <mark>MMP-2</mark> was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 63 cases of HCC and matched adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues.
Relationships between protein expression and clinicopathological parameters were assessed, and the correlations between <mark>NEK2</mark> with phospho-<mark>AKT</mark> and <mark>MMP-2</mark> expressions were evaluated.
A total of 610 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were revealed in the transcriptome comparison, 297 of which were upregulated and 313 were downregulated in HCC.
<mark>NEK2</mark>, as the most obviously different DEG in cells and tissues from the RNA-seq data, was listed as an HCC candidate biomarker for further verification.
<mark>NEK2</mark> was overexpressed in HCC cells and tissues (P=0.002, P=0.013) and HCC patients with a high expression of <mark>NEK2</mark> had a poor prognosis (P=0.0145).
Clinical analysis indicated that the overexpression of <mark>NEK2</mark> in HCC was significantly correlated with diolame complete (P<0.001), tumor nodule number (P=0.012) and recurrence (P=0.004).
<mark>NEK2</mark> expression was positively correlated with the expression of phospho-<mark>AKT</mark> (r=0.883, P<0.01) and <mark>MMP-2</mark> (r=0.781, P<0.01).
Overexpression of <mark>NEK2</mark> was associated with clinicopathological characteristics and poor patient outcomes, suggesting that <mark>NEK2</mark> serves as a prognostic biomarker for HCC.
Alteration of <mark>NEK2</mark> protein levels may contribute to invasion and metastasis of HCC, which may occur through activation of <mark>AKT</mark> signaling and promotion of <mark>MMP-2</mark> expression.
<mark>HIF-1α</mark> induction during reperfusion avoids maladaptive repair after renal ischemia/reperfusion involving <mark>miR127-3p</mark>.
Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) leads to Acute Kidney Injury.
<mark>HIF-1α</mark> is a key factor during organ response to I/R. We previously demonstrated that <mark>HIF-1α</mark> is induced during renal reperfusion, after ischemia.
Here we investigate the role of <mark>HIF-1α</mark> and the <mark>HIF-1α</mark> dependent mechanisms in renal repair after ischemia.
By interference of <mark>HIF-1α</mark> in a rat model of renal I/R, we observed loss of expression and mis-localization of <mark>e-cadherin</mark> and induction of <mark>α-SMA</mark>, <mark>MMP-13</mark>, <mark>TGFβ</mark>, and <mark>collagen I</mark>.
Moreover, we demonstrate that <mark>HIF-1α</mark> inhibition promotes renal cell infiltrates by inducing <mark>IL-1β</mark>, <mark>TNF-α</mark>, <mark>MCP-1</mark> and <mark>VCAM-1</mark>, through <mark>NFkB</mark> activity.
In addition, <mark>HIF-1α</mark> inhibition induced proximal tubule cells proliferation but it did not induce compensatory apoptosis, both in vivo.
In vitro, <mark>HIF-1α</mark> knockdown in HK2 cells subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) promote cell entry into S phase, correlating with in vivo data.
<mark>HIF-1α</mark> interference leads to downregulation of <mark>miR-127-3p</mark> and induction of its target gene <mark>Bcl6</mark> in vivo.
Moreover, modulation of <mark>miR-127-3p</mark> in HK2 cells subjected to H/R results in EMT regulation: <mark>miR127-3p</mark> inhibition promote loss of <mark>e-cadherin</mark> and induction of <mark>α-SMA</mark> and <mark>collagen I</mark>.
In conclusion, <mark>HIF-1α</mark> induction during reperfusion is a protector mechanism implicated in a normal renal tissue repair after I/R.
Higher <mark>IGFBP-1</mark> to <mark>IGF-1</mark> serum ratio predicts unfavourable survival in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
BACKGROUND: The <mark>insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system</mark> plays an important role in the development and progression of cancer.
However, little is known about the expression of the <mark>IGF system</mark> components and their clinicopathological significance and prognostic value in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
METHODS: <mark>IGF system</mark> components (<mark>IGF-1</mark>, <mark>IGF-2</mark>, <mark>IGF-1SR</mark>, <mark>IGFBP-1</mark>, <mark>IGFBP-2</mark>, <mark>IGFBP-3</mark>, <mark>IGFBP-4</mark> and <mark>IGFBP-6</mark>) were quantified from the plasma of NPC patients and healthy individuals using the RayBio Human Cytokine Antibody Array.
<mark>IGFBP-1</mark> and <mark>IGF-1</mark> mRNA levels were quantified by real-time qPCR, and protein expression was detected by western blot in nine NPC cell lines and four immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial (NPE) cell lines.
Tissue-specific expression of <mark>IGFBP-1</mark> and <mark>IGF-1</mark> was detected by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded NPC tissues.
ELISA analysis was used to measure the serum levels of <mark>IGFBP-1</mark> and <mark>IGF-1</mark> in 142 NPC patients and 128 healthy controls and determine potential correlation with clinicopathological parameters.
RESULTS: Significantly higher levels of circulating <mark>IGFBP-1</mark> and lower levels of <mark>IGF-1</mark> and <mark>IGF-2</mark> were detected in NPC patients compared to healthy controls by Cytokine Antibody Array analyses (P = 0.034, 0.012, 0.046, respectively).
<mark>IGFBP-1</mark> expression was detected in the majority of NPC cell lines, but not in NPE cell lines, and was shown to localize to the nucleus of tumour cells, in contrast to the cytoplasmic staining observed in normal cells.
Importantly, <mark>IGFBP-1</mark> expression was stronger in NPC tumour tissues compared to peritumoural tissues.
In contrast, <mark>IGF-1</mark> expression was weak or absent in NPC and NPE cell lines, with the exception of the EBV-infected C666 cell line, and was found to be expressed at lower levels in tumour tissues compared to tumour-adjacent normal tissue.
Levels of serum <mark>IGFBP-1</mark> were shown to be significantly higher in patients with NPCs compared to healthy control individuals (55.23 ± 41.25 μg/L vs. 32.08 ± 29.73 μg/L, P < 0.001), whereas serum levels of <mark>IGF-1</mark> were significantly lower in NPC patients compared to healthy controls (98.14 ± 71.48 μg/L vs. 164.01 ± 92.08 μg/L, P = 0.001).
Consistently, the <mark>IGFBP-1</mark>/<mark>IGF-1</mark> serum ratio was shown to be significantly higher in NPC patients compared to healthy control individuals (P = 0.002).
Serum levels of <mark>IGFBP-1</mark> and the <mark>IGFBP-1</mark>/<mark>IGF-1</mark> ratio significantly correlated with age (P = 0.020; P = 0.016), WHO histological classification (P = 0.044; P = 0.048), titre of EA (EB Virus Capsid Antigen-IgA) and NPC (P = 0.015; P = 0.016).
In contrast, higher <mark>IGFBP-1</mark> serum levels and <mark>IGFBP-1</mark>/<mark>IGF-1</mark> ratio significantly correlated with poor RFS (P = 0.046; P = 0.037) and OS (P = 0.038; P = 0.009).
Multivariate analysis revealed that the <mark>IGFBP-1</mark>/<mark>IGF-1</mark> ratio, but not serum <mark>IGFBP-1</mark> level, represents an independent risk factor for poor RFS (P = 0.044) and OS (P = 0.035).
CONCLUSIONS: A higher <mark>IGFBP-1</mark>/<mark>IGF-1</mark> serum ratio is significantly associated with poor prognosis in NPC patients.
Structural basis of <mark>Mcm2-7</mark> replicative helicase loading by <mark>ORC</mark>-<mark>Cdc6</mark> and <mark>Cdt1</mark>.
To initiate DNA replication, the <mark>origin recognition complex</mark> (<mark>ORC</mark>) and <mark>Cdc6</mark> load an <mark>Mcm2-7</mark> double hexamer onto DNA.
Without ATP hydrolysis, <mark>ORC</mark>-<mark>Cdc6</mark> recruits one <mark>Cdt1</mark>-bound <mark>Mcm2-7</mark> hexamer, thus forming an <mark>ORC</mark>-<mark>Cdc6</mark>-<mark>Cdt1</mark>-<mark>Mcm2-7</mark> (OCCM) helicase-loading intermediate.
Here we report a 3.9-Å structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae OCCM on DNA.
Flexible <mark>Mcm2-7</mark> winged-helix domains (WHDs) engage <mark>ORC</mark>-<mark>Cdc6</mark>.
A three-domain <mark>Cdt1</mark> configuration embraces <mark>Mcm2</mark>, <mark>Mcm4</mark>, and <mark>Mcm6</mark>, thus comprising nearly half of the hexamer.
The <mark>Cdt1</mark> C-terminal domain extends to the <mark>Mcm6</mark> WHD, which binds the <mark>Orc4</mark> WHD.
DNA passes through the ORC-<mark>Cdc6</mark> and <mark>Mcm2-7</mark> rings.
Origin DNA interaction is mediated by an α-helix within <mark>Orc4</mark> and positively charged loops within <mark>Orc2</mark> and <mark>Cdc6</mark>.
The <mark>Mcm2-7</mark> C-tier AAA+ ring is topologically closed by an <mark>Mcm5</mark> loop that embraces <mark>Mcm2</mark>, but the N-tier-ring <mark>Mcm2</mark>-<mark>Mcm5</mark> interface remains open.
This structure suggests a loading mechanism of the first <mark>Cdt1</mark>-bound <mark>Mcm2-7</mark> hexamer by <mark>ORC</mark>-<mark>Cdc6</mark>.
<mark>ZRF1</mark> is a novel <mark>S6 kinase</mark> substrate that drives the senescence programme.
The inactivation of <mark>S6 kinases</mark> mimics several aspects of caloric restriction, including small body size, increased insulin sensitivity and longevity.
However, the impact of <mark>S6 kinase</mark> activity on cellular senescence remains to be established.
Here, we show that the constitutive activation of <mark>mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1</mark> (<mark>mTORC1</mark>) by tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) mutations induces a premature senescence programme in fibroblasts that relies on <mark>S6 kinases</mark>.
To determine novel molecular targets linking <mark>S6 kinase</mark> activation to the control of senescence, we set up a chemical genetic screen, leading to the identification of the nuclear epigenetic factor <mark>ZRF1</mark> (also known as <mark>DNAJC2</mark>, <mark>MIDA1</mark>, <mark>Mpp11</mark>).
<mark>S6 kinases</mark> phosphorylate <mark>ZRF1</mark> on Ser47 in cultured cells and in mammalian tissues in vivo Knock-down of <mark>ZRF1</mark> or expression of a phosphorylation mutant is sufficient to blunt the <mark>S6 kinase</mark>-dependent senescence programme.
This is traced by a sharp alteration in <mark>p16</mark> levels, the cell cycle inhibitor and a master regulator of senescence.
Our findings reveal a mechanism by which nutrient sensing pathways impact on cell senescence through the activation of <mark>mTORC1</mark>-<mark>S6 kinases</mark> and the phosphorylation of <mark>ZRF1</mark>.
Protective effect of naringin against the LPS-induced apoptosis of PC12 cells: Implications for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.
Several studies have demonstrated that increased apoptosis plays an essential role in neurodegenerative disorders.
It has been demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces apoptosis largely through the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory mediators.
In this study, we investigated the potential protective mechanisms of naringin (Nar), a pummelo peel extract, on LPS-induced PC12 cell apoptosis.
Nar pre-conditioning prior to stimulation with LPS for 18 h was a prerequisite for evaluating PC12 cell viability and the protective mechanisms of Nar.
Nar significantly improved cell survival in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.
On the one hand, Nar downregulated <mark>cytochrome P450 2E1</mark> (<mark>CYP2E1</mark>), inhibited the release of ROS, mitigated the stimulation of oxidative stress, and rectified the antioxidant protein contents of <mark>nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2</mark> (<mark>Nrf2</mark>), <mark>heme oxygenase-1</mark> (<mark>HO-1</mark>), <mark>superoxide dismutase (SOD)2</mark> and <mark>glutathione synthetase</mark> (<mark>GSS</mark>).
On the other hand, Nar downregulated inflammatory gene and protein expression, including <mark>interleukin (IL)-1β</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α</mark>, <mark>HMGB1</mark>, <mark>high mobility group box 1 protein</mark> (<mark>HMGB1</mark>), <mark>cyclooxygenase-2</mark> (<mark>COX-2</mark>), the <mark>Toll-like receptor 4</mark> (<mark>TLR4</mark>)-<mark>myeloid differentiation factor 88</mark> (<mark>MyD88</mark>)-<mark>TNF receptor‑associated factor 6</mark> (<mark>TRAF6</mark>) path-way and downstream <mark>mitogen activated protein kinase</mark> (<mark>MAPK</mark>) phosphorylation, <mark>activator protein transcription factor-1</mark> (<mark>AP-1</mark>) and <mark>nuclear factor (NF)-κB</mark>.
Moroever, Nar markedly attenuated the <mark>cytochrome c</mark> shift from the mitochondria to the cytosol and regulated <mark>caspase-3</mark>-related protein expression.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of Nar in neuronal-like PC12 cells.
These results suggest that Nar can be utilized as a potential drug for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.
Reversal of <mark>DDK</mark>-Mediated <mark>MCM</mark> Phosphorylation by <mark>Rif1</mark>-<mark>PP1</mark> Regulates Replication Initiation and Replisome Stability Independently of <mark>ATR</mark>/<mark>Chk1</mark>.
<mark>Dbf4-dependent kinases</mark> (<mark>DDK</mark>s) are required for the initiation of DNA replication, their essential targets being the <mark>MCM2-7</mark> proteins.
We show that, in Xenopus laevis egg extracts and human cells, hyper-phosphorylation of DNA-bound <mark>Mcm4</mark>, but not phosphorylation of <mark>Mcm2</mark>, correlates with DNA replication.
These phosphorylations are differentially affected by the <mark>DDK</mark> inhibitors PHA-767491 and XL413.
We show that <mark>DDK</mark>-dependent <mark>MCM</mark> phosphorylation is reversed by <mark>protein phosphatase 1</mark> (<mark>PP1</mark>) targeted to chromatin by <mark>Rif1</mark>.
Loss of <mark>Rif1</mark> increased <mark>MCM</mark> phosphorylation and the rate of replication initiation and also compromised the ability of cells to block initiation when challenged with replication inhibitors.
We also provide evidence that <mark>Rif1</mark> can mediate <mark>MCM</mark> dephosphorylation at replication forks and that the stability of dephosphorylated replisomes strongly depends on <mark>Chk1</mark> activity.
We propose that both replication initiation and replisome stability depend on <mark>MCM</mark> phosphorylation, which is maintained by a balance of <mark>DDK</mark>-dependent phosphorylation and <mark>Rif1</mark>-mediated dephosphorylation.
<mark>GLUT4</mark> Is Not Necessary for Overload-Induced Glucose Uptake or Hypertrophic Growth in Mouse Skeletal Muscle.
<mark>GLUT4</mark> is necessary for acute insulin- and contraction-induced skeletal muscle glucose uptake, but its role in chronic muscle loading (overload)-induced glucose uptake is unknown.
Our goal was to determine whether <mark>GLUT4</mark> is required for overload-induced glucose uptake.
Overload was induced in mouse plantaris muscle by unilateral synergist ablation.
After 5 days, muscle weights and ex vivo [(3)H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake were assessed.
Overload-induced muscle glucose uptake and hypertrophic growth were not impaired in muscle-specific <mark>GLUT4</mark> knockout mice, demonstrating that <mark>GLUT4</mark> is not necessary for these processes.
To assess which transporters mediate overload-induced glucose uptake, chemical inhibitors were used.
The facilitative <mark>GLUT</mark> inhibitor cytochalasin B, but not the sodium-dependent glucose cotransport inhibitor phloridzin, prevented overload-induced uptake demonstrating that <mark>GLUTs</mark> mediate this effect.
To assess which <mark>GLUT</mark>, hexose competition experiments were performed.
Overload-induced [(3)H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake was not inhibited by d-fructose, demonstrating that the fructose-transporting <mark>GLUT2</mark>, <mark>GLUT5</mark>, <mark>GLUT8</mark>, and <mark>GLUT12</mark> do not mediate this effect.
To assess additional <mark>GLUTs</mark>, immunoblots were performed.
Overload increased <mark>GLUT1</mark>, <mark>GLUT3</mark>, <mark>GLUT6</mark>, and <mark>GLUT10</mark> protein levels twofold to fivefold.
Collectively, these results demonstrate that <mark>GLUT4</mark> is not necessary for overload-induced muscle glucose uptake or hypertrophic growth and suggest that <mark>GLUT1</mark>, <mark>GLUT3</mark>, <mark>GLUT6</mark>, and/or <mark>GLUT10</mark> mediate overload-induced glucose uptake.
The <mark>drebrin</mark>/<mark>EB3</mark> pathway drives invasive activity in prostate cancer.
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and the metastatic form of the disease is incurable.
We show here that the <mark>drebrin</mark>/<mark>EB3</mark> pathway, which co-ordinates dynamic microtubule/<mark>actin</mark> filament interactions underlying cell shape changes in response to guidance cues, plays a role in prostate cancer cell invasion.
<mark>Drebrin</mark> expression is restricted to basal epithelial cells in benign human prostate but is upregulated in luminal epithelial cells in foci of prostatic malignancy.
<mark>Drebrin</mark> is also upregulated in human prostate cancer cell lines and co-localizes with <mark>actin</mark> filaments and dynamic microtubules in filopodia of pseudopods of invading cells under a chemotactic gradient of the <mark>chemokine</mark> <mark>CXCL12</mark>.
Disruption of the <mark>drebrin</mark>/<mark>EB3</mark> pathway using BTP2, a small molecule inhibitor of <mark>drebrin</mark> binding to <mark>actin</mark> filaments, reduced the invasion of prostate cancer cell lines in 3D in vitro assays.
Furthermore, gain- or loss-of-function of <mark>drebrin</mark> or <mark>EB3</mark> by over-expression or siRNA-mediated knockdown increases or decreases invasion of prostate cancer cell lines in 3D in vitro assays, respectively.
Finally, expression of a dominant-negative construct that competes with <mark>EB3</mark> binding to <mark>drebrin</mark>, also inhibited invasion of prostate cancer cell lines in 3D in vitro assays.
Our findings show that co-ordination of dynamic microtubules and <mark>actin</mark> filaments by the <mark>drebrin</mark>/<mark>EB3</mark> pathway drives prostate cancer cell invasion and is therefore implicated in disease progression.
<mark>GPR143</mark> mutations in Chinese patients with ocular albinism type 1.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate mutations of the <mark>G protein-coupled receptor 143</mark> (<mark>GPR143</mark>) gene for ocular albinism type 1 (OA1) in Chinese patients.
For the current study, 8 patients with OA1 were selected from the database of ocular genetic diseases.
Genomic DNA of OA1 was prepared from venous leukocytes collected from the patients.
Cycle sequencing was used to analyze the exons and adjacent introns of <mark>GPR143</mark>.
The variation detected was analyzed by bidirectional DNA sequencing and further evaluated in 96 controls using heteroduplex‑single strand conformational polymorphism analysis.
Additionally, slit lamp photography of anterior segment, fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed to identify the clinical features of OA1.
In five patients with OA1, 5 <mark>GPR143</mark> gene mutations were identified and four of them there were novel mutations.
The screening rate is 62.5%, including c.333G>A (p.W111X), c.353G>A (p.G118E) (known mutation), C.658+2T>G (splice mutation), c.215_216insCGCTGC (p.71‑72insAA) and c.17T>C (p. L6P).
These mutations were absent in the 96 normal controls.
Only one patient with OA1 in the present study was female.
Patients with OA1 often have congenital nystagmus, refractive error, severe decline of visual acuity (from 0.1 to 0.4) and foveal hypoplasia.
Different degrees of pigment loss were evident in the patients' iris and retina, whereas macular structure was not identified in the OCT examination.
The findings of the present study expanded the gene mutation spectrum of <mark>GPR143</mark> and investigated the clinical phenotype of patients with OA1 in the Chinese population.
Additional evidence for clinical diagnosis was provided along with differential diagnosis and genetic counseling.
Deletion of endothelial cell-specific <mark>liver kinase B1</mark> increases angiogenesis and tumor growth via <mark>vascular endothelial growth factor</mark>.
<mark>Liver kinase B1</mark> (<mark>LKB1</mark>) is a <mark>serine/threonine protein kinase</mark> ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells.
It was first identified in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome as a tumor suppressor gene.
Whether endothelial <mark>LKB1</mark> regulates angiogenesis and tumor growth is unknown.
In this study, we generated endothelial cell-specific <mark>LKB1</mark>-knockout (<mark>LKB1</mark>(endo-/-)) mice by crossbreeding <mark>vascular endothelial-cadherin</mark>-<mark>Cre</mark> mice with <mark>LKB1</mark>(flox/flox) mice.
<mark>Vascular endothelial growth factor</mark> (<mark>VEGF</mark>) level was highly co-stained in endothelial cells but not in macrophages in <mark>LKB1</mark>(endo-/-) mice.
Consistently, <mark>LKB1</mark>(endo-/-) mouse tissues including the lung, skin, kidney and liver showed increased vascular permeability.
Tumors implanted in <mark>LKB1</mark>(endo-/-) mice but not macrophage-specific <mark>LKB1</mark>-knockout mice grew faster and showed enhanced vascular permeability and increased angiogenesis as compared with those implanted in wild-type mice.
Injection of VEGF-neutralizing antibody but not the isotype-matched control antibody decreased endothelial-cell angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo.
Furthermore, <mark>LKB1</mark> deletion enhanced mouse retinal and cell angiogenesis, and knockdown of <mark>VEGF</mark> by small-interfering RNA decreased endothelial cell proliferation and migration.
Re-expression of <mark>LKB1</mark> or knockdown of <mark>VEGF receptor 2</mark> decreased the overproliferation and -migration observed in <mark>LKB1</mark>(endo-/-) cells.
Mechanistically, <mark>LKB1</mark> could bind to the <mark>VEGF</mark> transcription factor, <mark>specificity protein 1</mark> (<mark>Sp1</mark>), which then inhibited the binding of <mark>Sp1</mark> to the <mark>VEGF</mark> promoter to reduce <mark>VEGF</mark> expression.
Endothelial <mark>LKB1</mark> may regulate endothelial angiogenesis and tumor growth by modulating <mark>Sp1</mark>-mediated <mark>VEGF</mark> expression.
Tissue-Specific Ablation of the <mark>LIF Receptor</mark> in the Murine Uterine Epithelium Results in Implantation Failure.
The cytokine <mark>leukemia inhibitory factor</mark> (<mark>LIF</mark>) is essential for rendering the uterus receptive for blastocyst implantation.
In mice, <mark>LIF receptor</mark> expression (<mark>LIFR</mark>) is largely restricted to the uterine luminal epithelium (LE).
<mark>LIF</mark>, secreted from the endometrial glands (GEs), binds to the <mark>LIFR</mark>, activating the <mark>Janus kinase</mark>-<mark>signal transducer and activation of transcription (STAT) 3</mark> (<mark>Jak</mark>-<mark>Stat3</mark>) signaling pathway in the LE.
<mark>JAK</mark>-<mark>STAT</mark> activation converts the LE to a receptive state so that juxtaposed blastocysts begin to implant.
To specifically delete the <mark>LIFR</mark> in the LE, we derived a line of mice in which Cre recombinase was inserted into the endogenous <mark>lactoferrin</mark> gene (<mark>Ltf</mark>-Cre).
<mark>Lactoferrin</mark> expression in the LE is induced by E2, and we demonstrate that Cre recombinase activity is restricted to the LE and GE.
To determine the requirement of the <mark>LIFR</mark> in implantation, we derived an additional mouse line carrying a conditional (floxed) <mark>Lifr</mark>flx/flx gene.
Crossing <mark>Ltf</mark>-Cre mice with <mark>Lifr</mark>flx/flx mice generated <mark>Lifr</mark>flx/Δ:<mark>Ltf</mark>Cre/+ females that were overtly normal but infertile.
Many of these females, despite repeated matings, did not become pregnant.
Unimplanted blastocysts were recovered from the <mark>Lifr</mark>flx/Δ:<mark>Ltf</mark>Cre/+ uteri and, when transferred to wild-type recipients, implanted normally, indicating that uterine receptivity rather than the embryo's competency is compromised.
The loss of <mark>Lifr</mark> results in both the failure for <mark>STAT3</mark> to translocate to the LE nuclei and a reduction in the expression of the <mark>LIF</mark> regulated gene <mark>Msx1</mark> that regulates uterine receptivity.
These results reveal that uterine expression of the <mark>LIFR</mark> is essential for embryo implantation and further define the components of the <mark>LIF</mark> signaling pathway necessary for effective implantation.
Defining a Novel Role for the <mark>Coxsackievirus and Adenovirus Receptor</mark> in Human Adenovirus Serotype 5 Transduction In Vitro in the Presence of Mouse Serum.
Human adenoviral serotype 5 (HAdV-5) vectors have predominantly hepatic tropism when delivered intravascularly, resulting in immune activation and toxicity.
<mark>Coagulation factor X</mark> (<mark>FX</mark>) binding to HAdV-5 mediates liver transduction and provides protection from virion neutralization in mice.
<mark>FX</mark> is dispensable for liver transduction in mice lacking <mark>IgM</mark> antibodies or <mark>complement</mark>, suggesting that alternative transduction pathways exist.
To identify novel factor(s) mediating HAdV-5 <mark>FX</mark>-independent entry, we investigated HAdV-5 transduction in vitro in the presence of serum from immunocompetent C57BL/6 or immunocompromised mice lacking <mark>IgM</mark> antibodies (<mark>Rag 2</mark>(-/-) and NOD-scid-gamma [NSG]).
Sera from all three mouse strains enhanced HAdV-5 transduction of A549 cells.
While inhibition of HAdV-5-<mark>FX</mark> interaction with <mark>FX</mark>-binding protein (X-bp) inhibited transduction in the presence of C57BL/6 serum, it had negligible effect on the enhanced transduction observed in the presence of <mark>Rag 2</mark>(-/-) or NSG serum.
<mark>Rag 2</mark>(-/-) serum also enhanced transduction of the <mark>FX</mark> binding-deficient HAdV-5HVR5*HVR7*E451Q (AdT*).
Interestingly, <mark>Rag 2</mark>(-/-) serum enhanced HAdV-5 transduction in a <mark>FX</mark>-independent manner in CHO-<mark>CAR</mark> and SKOV3-<mark>CAR</mark> cells (CHO or SKOV3 cells transfected to stably express human <mark>coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor</mark> [<mark>CAR</mark>]).
Additionally, blockade of <mark>CAR</mark> with soluble HAdV-5 fiber knob inhibited mouse serum-enhanced transduction in A549 cells, suggesting a potential role for <mark>CAR</mark>.
Transduction of HAdV-5 KO1 and HAdV-5/F35 (<mark>CAR</mark> binding deficient) in the presence of <mark>Rag 2</mark>(-/-) serum was equivalent to that of HAdV-5, indicating that direct interaction between HAdV-5 and <mark>CAR</mark> is not required.
These data suggest that <mark>FX</mark> may protect HAdV-5 from neutralization but has minimal contribution to HAdV-5 transduction in the presence of immunocompromised mouse serum.
Alternatively, transduction occurs via an unidentified mouse serum protein capable of bridging HAdV-5 to <mark>CAR</mark>.IMPORTANCE The intravascular administration of HAdV-5 vectors can result in acute liver toxicity, transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, and injury to the vascular endothelium, illustrating challenges yet to overcome for HAdV-5-mediated systemic gene therapy.
The finding that <mark>CAR</mark> and potentially an unidentified factor present in mouse serum might be important mediators of HAdV-5 transduction highlights that a better understanding of the complex biology defining the interplay between adenovirus immune recognition and cellular uptake mechanisms is still required.
These findings are important to inform future optimization and development of HAdV-5-based adenoviral vectors for gene therapy.
Biophysical and functional characterization of <mark>hippocalcin</mark> mutants responsible for human dystonia.
Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder that forces the body into twisting, repetitive movements or sometimes painful abnormal postures.
With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, the homozygous mutations T71N and A190T in the <mark>neuronal calcium sensor</mark> (<mark>NCS</mark>) <mark>hippocalcin</mark> were identified as the genetic cause of primary isolated dystonia (DYT2 dystonia).
However, the effect of these mutations on the physiological role of <mark>hippocalcin</mark> has not yet been elucidated.
Using a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrated that <mark>hippocalcin</mark> oligomerises in a calcium-dependent manner and binds to <mark>voltage-gated calcium channels</mark>.
Mutations T71N and A190T in <mark>hippocalcin</mark> did not affect stability, calcium-binding affinity or translocation to cellular membranes (Ca2+/myristoyl switch).
We obtained the first crystal structure of <mark>hippocalcin</mark> and alignment with other <mark>NCS proteins</mark> showed significant variability in the orientation of the C-terminal part of the molecule, the region expected to be important for target binding.
We demonstrated that the disease-causing mutations did not affect the structure of the protein, however both mutants showed a defect in oligomerisation.
In addition, we observed an increased calcium influx in KCl-depolarised cells expressing mutated <mark>hippocalcin</mark>, mostly driven by <mark>N-type voltage-gated calcium channels</mark>.
Our data demonstrate that the dystonia-causing mutations strongly affect <mark>hippocalcin</mark> cellular functions which suggest a central role for perturbed calcium signalling in DYT2 dystonia.
<mark>miR-21</mark> ablation and obeticholic acid ameliorate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in mice.
microRNAs were recently suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a disease lacking specific pharmacological treatments.
In that regard, nuclear receptors are arising as key molecular targets for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
Here we show that, in a typical model of NASH-associated liver damage, <mark>microRNA-21</mark> (<mark>miR-21</mark>) ablation results in a progressive decrease in steatosis, inflammation and lipoapoptosis, with impairment of fibrosis.
In a complementary fast food (FF) diet NASH model, mimicking features of the metabolic syndrome, <mark>miR-21</mark> levels increase in both liver and muscle, concomitantly with decreased expression of <mark>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a</mark> (<mark>PPARa</mark>), a key <mark>miR-21</mark> target.
Strikingly, <mark>miR-21</mark> knockout mice fed the FF diet supplemented with <mark>farnesoid X receptor</mark> (<mark>FXR</mark>) agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) display minimal steatosis, inflammation, oxidative stress and cholesterol accumulation.
In addition, lipoprotein metabolism was restored, including decreased fatty acid uptake and polyunsaturation, and liver and muscle insulin sensitivity fully reinstated.
Finally, the <mark>miR-21</mark>/<mark>PPARa</mark> axis was found amplified in liver and muscle biopsies, and in serum, of NAFLD patients, co-substantiating its role in the development of the metabolic syndrome.
By unveiling that <mark>miR-21</mark> abrogation, together with <mark>FXR</mark> activation by OCA, significantly improves whole body metabolic parameters in NASH, our results highlight the therapeutic potential of nuclear receptor multi-targeting therapies for NAFLD.
Associations Between Cancer Predisposition Testing Panel Genes and Breast Cancer.
Importance: Germline pathogenic variants in <mark>BRCA1</mark> and <mark>BRCA2</mark> predispose to an increased lifetime risk of breast cancer.
However, the relevance of germline variants in other genes from multigene hereditary cancer testing panels is not well defined.
Objective: To determine the risks of breast cancer associated with germline variants in cancer predisposition genes.
Design, Setting, and Participants: A study population of 65 057 patients with breast cancer receiving germline genetic testing of cancer predisposition genes with hereditary cancer multigene panels.
Associations between pathogenic variants in non-<mark>BRCA1</mark> and non-<mark>BRCA2</mark> predisposition genes and breast cancer risk were estimated in a case-control analysis of patients with breast cancer and Exome Aggregation Consortium reference controls.
The women underwent testing between March 15, 2012, and June 30, 2016.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Breast cancer risk conferred by pathogenic variants in non-<mark>BRCA1</mark> and non-<mark>BRCA2</mark> predisposition genes.
Results: The mean (SD) age at diagnosis for the 65 057 women included in the analysis was 48.5 (11.1) years.
The frequency of pathogenic variants in 21 panel genes identified in 41 611 consecutively tested white women with breast cancer was estimated at 10.2%.
After exclusion of <mark>BRCA1</mark>, <mark>BRCA2</mark>, and syndromic breast cancer genes (<mark>CDH1</mark>, <mark>PTEN</mark>, and <mark>TP53</mark>), observed pathogenic variants in 5 of 16 genes were associated with high or moderately increased risks of breast cancer: <mark>ATM</mark> (OR, 2.78; 95% CI, 2.22-3.62), <mark>BARD1</mark> (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.31-3.63), <mark>CHEK2</mark> (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.31-1.67), <mark>PALB2</mark> (OR, 7.46; 95% CI, 5.12-11.19), and <mark>RAD51D</mark> (OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.21-7.88).
Conversely, variants in the <mark>BRIP1</mark> and <mark>RAD51C</mark> ovarian cancer risk genes; the <mark>MRE11A</mark>, <mark>RAD50</mark>, and <mark>NBN</mark> <mark>MRN complex</mark> genes; the <mark>MLH1</mark> and <mark>PMS2</mark> mismatch repair genes; and <mark>NF1</mark> were not associated with increased risks of breast cancer.
Conclusions and Relevance: This study establishes several panel genes as high- and moderate-risk breast cancer genes and provides estimates of breast cancer risk associated with pathogenic variants in these genes among individuals qualifying for clinical genetic testing.
Distinct immunophenotypes and prognostic factors in renal cell carcinoma with sarcomatoid differentiation: a systematic study of 19 immunohistochemical markers in 42 cases.
BACKGROUND: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with sarcomatoid differentiation is a relatively rare tumor containing both carcinoma and sarcomatoid components.
However, there has not been a systemic study on immunophenotypes of renal cell carcinoma with sarcomatoid differentiation, especially using some renal specific immunohistochemical markers.
In this study, we aimed to comprehensively investigate the distinct immunophenotypes of RCC with sarcomatoid differentiation to analyze the pathogenesis of sarcomatoid differentiation and identify new prognostic factors in RCC with sarcomatoid differentiation.
METHODS: A total of 42 cases of RCCs with sarcomatoid differentiation were enrolled into the study.
Immunohistochemistry study was performed on tissue microarrays to evaluate the expressions of 19 immunohistochemical markers including a series of epithelial, mesenchymal markers and RCC specific markers.
Kaplan-Meier method was applied to assess the prognostic values of <mark>CD10</mark>, <mark>CAIX</mark>, <mark>p53</mark> and <mark>Bcl-2</mark>.
RESULTS: Histologically, 42 cases of RCCs with sarcomatoid differentiation presented with different proportions of carcinoma and sarcomatoid components.
The cohort contained 35 cases of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) and 7 cases of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC) based on the carcinoma components.
Immunohistochemically, all cases were positive for <mark>vimentin</mark>, and 80% of cases showed immunostaining for at least one epithelial marker, such as <mark>CK</mark>, <mark>EMA</mark>, <mark>CK7</mark> and <mark>CK18</mark>.
Notably, the expression rates of <mark>CAIX</mark>, <mark>CD10</mark> and <mark>PAX8</mark> in sarcomatoid cells were 76%, 76% and 64%, respectively.
The carcinoma component of the tumors showed differentient labeling for <mark>CAIX</mark>, <mark>CD10</mark>, <mark>vimentin</mark>, <mark>CK7</mark> and <mark>CD117</mark> in CCRCC vs ChRCC, but the sarcomatoid component lost the specificity for these markers ( p < 0.05).
Patients with positive expressions of <mark>CAIX</mark>, <mark>p53</mark> and <mark>Bcl-2</mark> had a poor prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The sarcomatoid cells in RCC with sarcomatoid differentiation express both epithelial and mesenchymal markers, supporting their epithelial origin.
<mark>PAX8</mark>, <mark>CAIX</mark> and <mark>CD10</mark> could be used as the reliable and useful markers to determine the renal origin of sarcomatoid cells such as in fine needle aspiration cases and metastatic RCC with sarcomatoid differentiation.
<mark>CAIX</mark>, <mark>p53</mark> and <mark>Bcl-2</mark> might play important roles in the transformation from renal cell carcinoma to high malignant sarcomatoid differentiation, and these three immunohistochemical markers are adverse prognostic factors for the survival of patients with RCC with sarcomatoid differentiation.
Hypoglycemic Effect of Combined <mark>Ghrelin</mark> and <mark>Glucagon Receptor</mark> Blockade.
<mark>Glucagon receptor</mark> (<mark>GcgR</mark>) blockade has been proposed as an alternative to insulin monotherapy for treating type 1 diabetes since deletion or inhibition of <mark>GcgR</mark>s corrects hyperglycemia in models of diabetes.
The factors regulating glycemia in a setting devoid of <mark>insulin</mark> and <mark>glucagon</mark> function remain unclear but may include the hormone <mark>ghrelin</mark>.
Not only is <mark>ghrelin</mark> release controlled by glucose but also <mark>ghrelin</mark> has many actions that can raise or reduce falls in blood glucose level.
Here, we tested the hypothesis that <mark>ghrelin</mark> rises to prevent hypoglycemia in the absence of <mark>glucagon</mark> function.
Both <mark>GcgR</mark> knockout (<mark>Gcgr</mark>(-/-)) mice and db/db mice that were administered <mark>GcgR</mark> monoclonal antibody displayed lower blood glucose levels accompanied by elevated plasma <mark>ghrelin</mark> levels.
Although treatment with the pancreatic β-cell toxin streptozotocin induced hyperglycemia and raised plasma <mark>ghrelin</mark> levels in wild-type mice, hyperglycemia was averted in similarly treated <mark>Gcgr</mark>(-/-) mice and the plasma <mark>ghrelin</mark> level was further increased.
Notably, administration of a <mark>ghrelin receptor</mark> antagonist further reduced blood glucose levels into the markedly hypoglycemic range in overnight-fasted, streptozotocin-treated <mark>Gcgr</mark>(-/-) mice.
A lowered blood glucose level also was observed in overnight-fasted, streptozotocin-treated <mark>ghrelin receptor</mark>-null mice that were administered <mark>GcgR</mark> monoclonal antibody.
These data suggest that when <mark>glucagon</mark> activity is blocked in the setting of type 1 diabetes, the plasma <mark>ghrelin</mark> level rises, preventing hypoglycemia.
Urinary Levels of <mark>IL-1β</mark> and <mark>GDNF</mark> in Preterm Neonates as Potential Biomarkers of Motor Development: A Prospective Study.
Objectives. To evaluate the association between inflammatory biomarkers, neurotrophic factors, birth conditions, and the presence of motor development abnormalities in preterm neonates.
Methods.
Plasma and urinary levels of <mark>cytokines</mark> (<mark>IL-1β</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-10</mark>, <mark>TNF</mark>, and <mark>IL-12p70</mark>), <mark>chemokines</mark> (<mark>CXCL8</mark>/<mark>IL-8</mark>, <mark>CCL2</mark>/<mark>MCP-1</mark>, <mark>CCL5</mark>/<mark>RANTES</mark>, <mark>CXCL10</mark>/<mark>IP-10</mark>, and <mark>CXCL9</mark>/<mark>MIG</mark>), and neurotrophic factors (<mark>BDNF</mark> and <mark>GDNF</mark>) were evaluated in 40 preterm neonates born between 28 and 32 incomplete weeks of gestation, at four distinct time points: at birth (umbilical cord blood) (T0), at 48 (T1), at 72 hours (T2), and at 3 weeks after birth (T3).
Biomarkers levels were compared between different time points and then associated with Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP) percentiles.
Results.
Maternal age, plasma, and urinary concentrations of inflammatory molecules and neurotrophic factors were significantly different between groups with normal versus lower than expected motor development.
Higher levels of <mark>GDNF</mark> were found in the group with lower than expected motor development, while <mark>IL-1β</mark> and <mark>CXCL8</mark>/<mark>IL-8</mark> values were higher in the group with typical motor development.
Conclusion.
Measurements of cytokines and neurotrophic factors in spot urine may be useful in the follow-up of motor development in preterm neonates.
<mark>UBASH3A</mark> Mediates Risk for Type 1 Diabetes Through Inhibition of <mark>T-Cell Receptor</mark>-Induced <mark>NF-κB</mark> Signaling.
Although over 40 type 1 diabetes (T1D) risk loci have been mapped in humans, the causative genes and variants for T1D are largely unknown.
Here, we investigated a candidate gene in the 21q22.3 risk locus-<mark>UBASH3A</mark>, which is primarily expressed in T cells where it is thought to play a largely redundant role.
Genetic variants in <mark>UBASH3A</mark> have been shown to be associated with several autoimmune diseases in addition to T1D.
However, the molecular mechanism underlying these genetic associations is unresolved.
Our study reveals a previously unrecognized role of <mark>UBASH3A</mark> in human T cells: <mark>UBASH3A</mark> attenuates the <mark>NF-κB</mark> signal transduction upon <mark>T-cell receptor</mark> (<mark>TCR</mark>) stimulation by specifically suppressing the activation of the <mark>IκB kinase</mark> complex.
We identify novel interactions of <mark>UBASH3A</mark> with nondegradative <mark>polyubiquitin</mark> chains, <mark>TAK1</mark> and <mark>NEMO</mark>, suggesting that <mark>UBASH3A</mark> regulates the <mark>NF-κB</mark> signaling pathway by an <mark>ubiquitin</mark>-dependent mechanism.
Finally, we show that risk alleles at rs11203203 and rs80054410, two T1D-associated variants in <mark>UBASH3A</mark>, increase <mark>UBASH3A</mark> expression in human primary <mark>CD4</mark>(+) T cells upon <mark>TCR</mark> stimulation, inhibiting <mark>NF-κB</mark> signaling via its effects on the <mark>IκB kinase</mark> complex and resulting in reduced <mark>IL2</mark> gene expression.
Domain-specific control of germ cell polarity and migration by multifunction <mark>Tre1 GP<mark>Tre1</mark>m<mark>GPCR</mark>.
The migration of primordial germ cells (PGCs) from their place of origin to the embryonic gonad is an essential reproductive feature in many animal species.
In Drosophila melanogaster, a single <mark>G protein-coupled receptor</mark>, <mark>Trapped in endoderm 1</mark> (<mark>Tre1</mark>), mediates germ cell polarization at the onset of active migration and directs subsequent migration of PGCs through the midgut primordium.
How these different aspects of cell behavior are coordinated through a single receptor is not known.
We demonstrate that two highly conserved domains, the E/N/DRY and NPxxY motifs, have overlapping and unique functions in <mark>Tre1</mark>.
The <mark>Tre1</mark>-NRY domain via <mark>G protein</mark> signaling is required for reading and responding to guidance and survival cues controlled by the <mark>lipid phosphate phosphatases</mark> <mark>Wunen</mark> and <mark>Wunen2</mark>.
In contrast, the <mark>Tre1</mark>-NPIIY domain has a separate role in <mark>Rho1</mark>- and <mark>E-cadherin</mark>-mediated polarization at the initiation stage independent of <mark>G protein</mark> signaling.
We propose that this bifurcation of the <mark>Tre1</mark> <mark>G protein-coupled receptor</mark> signaling response via <mark>G protein</mark>-dependent and independent branches enables distinct spatiotemporal regulation of germ cell migration.
Novel function of a <mark>dynein light chain</mark> in <mark>actin</mark> assembly during <mark>clathrin</mark>-mediated endocytosis.
<mark>Clathrin</mark>- and <mark>actin</mark>-mediated endocytosis is essential in eukaryotic cells.
In this study, we demonstrate that <mark>Tda2</mark> is a novel protein of the endocytic machinery necessary for normal internalization of native cargo in yeast.
<mark>Tda2</mark> has not been classified in any protein family.
Unexpectedly, solving the crystal structure of <mark>Tda2</mark> revealed it belongs to the <mark>dynein light chain</mark> family.
However, <mark>Tda2</mark> works independently of the <mark>dynein motor complex</mark> and microtubules.
<mark>Tda2</mark> forms a tight complex with the polyproline motif-rich protein <mark>Aim21</mark>, which interacts physically with the SH3 domain of the <mark>Arp2</m<mark>Arp2/3 compl<mark>3</mark>x regulator</mark> <mark>Bbc1</mark>.
The <mark>Tda2</mark>-<mark>Aim21</mark> complex localizes to endocytic sites in a <mark>Bbc1</mark>- and filamentous <mark>actin</mark>-dependent manner.
Importantly, the <mark>Tda2</mark>-<mark>Aim21</mark> complex interacts directly with and facilitates the recruitment of <mark>actin-capping protein</mark>, revealing barbed-end filament capping at endocytic sites to be a regulated event.
Thus, we have uncovered a new layer of regulation of the <mark>actin</mark> cytoskeleton by a member of a conserved protein family that has not been previously associated with a function in endocytosis.
Yeast silencing factor <mark>Sir4</mark> and a subset of <mark>nucleoporins</mark> form a complex distinct from <mark>nuclear pore complex</mark>es.
Interactions occurring at the nuclear envelope (NE)-chromatin interface influence both NE structure and chromatin organization.
Insights into the functions of NE-chromatin interactions have come from the study of yeast subtelomeric chromatin and its association with the NE, including the identification of various proteins necessary for tethering subtelomeric chromatin to the NE and the silencing of resident genes.
Here we show that four of these proteins-the silencing factor <mark>Sir4</mark>, NE-associated <mark>Esc1</mark>, the <mark>SUMO E3 ligase</mark> <mark>Siz2</mark>, and the <mark>nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein</mark> <mark>Nup170</mark>-physically and functionally interact with one another and a subset of <mark>NPC components</mark> (<mark>nucleoporins</mark> or <mark>Nups</mark>).
Importantly, this group of <mark>Nups</mark> is largely restricted to members of the inner and outer NPC rings, but it lacks numerous others including cytoplasmically and nucleoplasmically positioned <mark>Nups</mark>.
We propose that this <mark>Sir4</mark>-associated Nup complex is distinct from holo-NPCs and that it plays a role in subtelomeric chromatin organization and NE tethering.
<mark>IRF-8</mark> regulates expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and <mark>Foxp3</mark>+ regulatory T cells and modulates Th2 immune responses to gastrointestinal nematode infection.
<mark>Interferon regulatory factor-8</mark> (<mark>IRF-8</mark>) is critical for Th1 cell differentiation and negatively regulates myeloid cell development including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC).
MDSC expand during infection with various pathogens including the gastrointestinal (GI) nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb).
We investigated if <mark>IRF-8</mark> contributes to Th2 immunity to Hpb infection.
<mark>Irf8</mark> expression was down-regulated in MDSC from Hpb-infected C57BL/6 (B6) mice.
<mark>IRF-8</mark> deficient <mark>Irf8</mark>-/- and BXH-2 mice had significantly higher adult worm burdens than B6 mice after primary or challenge Hpb infection.
During primary infection, MDSC expanded to a significantly greater extent in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and spleens of <mark>Irf8</mark>-/- and BXH-2 than B6 mice.
<mark>CD4</mark>+<mark>GATA3</mark>+ T cells numbers were comparable in MLN of infected B6 and <mark>IRF-8</mark> deficient mice, but MLN cells from infected <mark>IRF-8</mark> deficient mice secreted significantly less parasite-specific <mark>IL-4</mark> ex vivo.
The numbers of alternatively activated macrophages in MLN and serum levels of Hpb-specific <mark>IgG1</mark> and <mark>IgE</mark> were also significantly less in infected <mark>Irf8</mark>-/- than B6 mice.
The frequencies of antigen-experienced <mark>CD4</mark>+<mark>CD11a</mark>hi<mark>CD49d</mark>hi cells that were <mark>CD44</mark>hi<mark>CD62L</mark>- were similar in MLN of infected <mark>Irf8</mark>-/- and B6 mice, but the proportions of <mark>CD4</mark>+<mark>GATA3</mark>+ and <mark>CD4</mark>+<mark>IL-4</mark>+ T cells were lower in infected <mark>Irf8</mark>-/- mice.
<mark>CD11b</mark>+<mark>Gr1</mark>+ cells from naïve or infected <mark>Irf8</mark>-/- mice suppressed <mark>CD4</mark>+ T cell proliferation and parasite-specific <mark>IL-4</mark> secretion in vitro albeit less efficiently than B6 mice.
Surprisingly, there were significantly more <mark>CD4</mark>+ T cells in infected <mark>Irf8</mark>-/- mice, with a higher frequency of <mark>CD4</mark>+<mark>CD25</mark>+<mark>Foxp3</mark>+ T (Tregs) cells and significantly higher numbers of Tregs than B6 mice.
In vivo depletion of MDSC and/or Tregs in <mark>Irf8</mark>-/- mice did not affect adult worm burdens, but Treg depletion resulted in higher egg production and enhanced parasite-specific <mark>IL-5</mark>, <mark>IL-13</mark>, and <mark>IL-6</mark> secretion ex vivo.
Our data thus provide a previously unrecognized role for <mark>IRF-8</mark> in Th2 immunity to a GI nematode.
<mark>Arginase 1</mark> deletion in myeloid cells affects the inflammatory response in allergic asthma, but not lung mechanics, in female mice.
BACKGROUND: (Over-)expression of <mark>arginase</mark> may limit local availability of arginine for nitric oxide synthesis.
We investigated the significance of <mark>arginase1</mark> (<mark>ARG1</mark>) for the development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and lung inflammation in female mice with <mark>ovalbumin</mark> (<mark>OVA</mark>)-induced allergic asthma.
METHODS: <mark>Arg1</mark> was ablated in the lung by crossing <mark>Arg1</mark> fl/fl and <mark>Tie2</mark>Cre tg/- mice.
<mark>OVA</mark> sensitization and challenge were conducted, and AHR to methacholine was determined using the Flexivent system.
Changes in gene expression, <mark>chemokine</mark> and <mark>cytokine</mark> secretion, plasma <mark>IgE</mark>, and lung histology were quantified using RT-qPCR, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry, respectively.
RESULTS: <mark>Arg1</mark> ablation had no influence on the development of <mark>OVA</mark>-induced AHR, but attenuated <mark>OVA</mark>-induced increases in expression of <mark>Arg2</mark> and <mark>Nos2</mark>, <mark>Slc7a1</mark>, <mark>Slc7a2</mark>, and <mark>Slc7a7</mark> (<mark>arginine transporters</mark>), <mark>Il4</mark>, <mark>Il5</mark> and <mark>Il13</mark> (<mark>TH2-type cytokines</mark>), <mark>Ccl2</mark> and <mark>Ccl11</mark> (<mark>chemokines</mark>), <mark>Ifng</mark> (<mark>TH1-type cytokine</mark>), <mark>Clca3</mark> and <mark>Muc5ac</mark> (goblet cell markers), and <mark>OVA</mark>-specific <mark>IgE</mark>.
Pulmonary <mark>IL-10</mark> protein content increased, but <mark>IL-4</mark>, <mark>IL-5</mark>, <mark>IL-13</mark>, <mark>TNFalpha</mark> and <mark>IFNgamma</mark> content, and lung histopathology, were not affected.
<mark>Arg1</mark> elimination also decreased number and tightness of correlations between adaptive changes in lung function and inflammatory parameters in <mark>OVA</mark>/<mark>OVA</mark>-treated female mice.
<mark>OVA</mark>/<mark>OVA</mark>-treated female mice mounted a higher <mark>OVA</mark>-<mark>IgE</mark> response than males, but the correlation between lung function and inflammation was lower.
<mark>Arg1</mark>-deficient <mark>OVA</mark>/<mark>OVA</mark>-treated females differed from males in a more pronounced decline of arginine-metabolizing and -transporting genes, higher plasma arginine levels, a smaller <mark>OVA</mark>-specific <mark>IgE</mark> response, and no improvement of peripheral lung function.
CONCLUSION: Complete ablation of <mark>Arg1</mark> in the lung affects mRNA abundance of arginine-transporting and -metabolizing genes, and pro-inflammatory genes, but not methacholine responsiveness or accumulation of inflammatory cells.
<mark>HEB</mark> is required for the specification of fetal <mark>IL-17</mark>-producing γδ T cells.
<mark>IL-17</mark>-producing γδ T (γδT17) cells are critical components of the innate immune system.
However, the gene networks that control their development are unclear.
Here we show that <mark>HEB</mark> (<mark>HeLa E-box binding protein</mark>, encoded by <mark>Tcf12</mark>) is required for the generation of a newly defined subset of fetal-derived <mark>CD73</mark>- γδT17 cells.
<mark>HEB</mark> is required in immature <mark>CD24</mark>+<mark>CD73</mark>- γδ T cells for the expression of <mark>Sox4</mark>, <mark>Sox13</mark>, and <mark>Rorc</mark>, and these genes are repressed by acute expression of the <mark>HEB</mark> antagonist <mark>Id3</mark>.
<mark>HEB</mark>-deficiency also affects mature <mark>CD73</mark>+ γδ T cells, which are defective in <mark>RORγt</mark> expression and <mark>IL-17</mark> production.
Additionally, the fetal <mark>TCRγ</mark> chain repertoire is altered, and peripheral <mark>Vγ4</mark> γδ T cells are mostly restricted to the <mark>IFNγ</mark>-producing phenotype in <mark>HEB</mark>-deficient mice.
Therefore, our work identifies <mark>HEB</mark>-dependent pathways for the development of <mark>CD73</mark>+ and <mark>CD73</mark>- γδT17 cells, and provides mechanistic evidence for control of the γδT17 gene network by <mark>HEB</mark>.
Loss of <mark>solute carrier family 7 member 2</mark> exacerbates inflammation-associated colon tumorigenesis.
<mark>Solute carrier family 7 member 2</mark> (<mark>SLC7A2</mark>, also known as <mark>CAT2</mark>) is an inducible transporter of the semi-essential amino acid L-arginine (L-Arg), which has been implicated in wound repair.
We have reported that both <mark>SLC7A2</mark> expression and L-Arg availability are decreased in colonic tissues from inflammatory bowel disease patients and that mice lacking <mark>Slc7a2</mark> exhibit a more severe disease course when exposed to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) compared to wild-type (WT) mice.
Here, we present evidence that <mark>SLC7A2</mark> plays a role in modulating colon tumorigenesis in the azoxymethane (AOM)-DSS model of colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC).
<mark>SLC7A2</mark> was localized predominantly to colonic epithelial cells in WT mice.
Utilizing the AOM-DSS model, <mark>Slc7a2</mark>-/- mice had significantly increased tumor number, burden, and risk of high-grade dysplasia vs. WT mice.
Tumors from <mark>Slc7a2</mark>-/- mice exhibited significantly increased levels of the proinflammatory <mark>cytokines</mark>/<mark>chemokines</mark> <mark>IL-1beta</mark>, <mark>CXCL1</mark>, <mark>CXCL5</mark>, <mark>IL-3</mark>, <mark>CXCL2</mark>, <mark>CCL3</mark>, and <mark>CCL4</mark>, but decreased levels of <mark>IL-4</mark>, <mark>CXCL9</mark>, and <mark>CXCL10</mark> compared to tumors from WT mice.
This was accompanied by a shift toward pro-tumorigenic M2 macrophage activation in <mark>Slc7a2</mark>-deficient mice, as marked by increased colonic <mark>CD11b</mark>+F4/80+<mark>ARG1</mark>+ cells with no alteration in <mark>CD11b</mark>+F4/80+NOS2+ cells by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy.
The shift toward M2 macrophage activation was confirmed in bone marrow-derived macrophages from <mark>Slc7a2</mark>-/- mice.
In bone marrow chimeras between <mark>Slc7a2</mark>-/- and WT mice, the recipient genotype drove the CAC phenotype, suggesting the importance of epithelial <mark>SLC7A2</mark> in abrogating neoplastic risk.
These data reveal that <mark>SLC7A2</mark> has a significant role in the protection from CAC in the setting of chronic colitis, and suggest that the decreased <mark>SLC7A2</mark> in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may contribute to CAC risk.
Strategies to enhance L-Arg availability by supplementing L-Arg and/or increasing L-Arg uptake could represent a therapeutic approach in IBD to reduce the substantial long-term risk of colorectal carcinoma.
Overexpression of <mark>small ubiquitin-like modifier 2</mark> ameliorates high glucose-induced reductions in cardiomyocyte proliferation via the <mark>transforming growth factor-beta</mark>/<mark>Smad</mark> pathway.
Hyperglycemia may induce diabetic cardiomyopathy (DC).
In the current study, the mechanism underlying the alleviation of high glucose (HG)-induced impairments in the proliferation of H9c2 embryo cardiomyocyte proliferation by <mark>small ubiquitin-like modifier 2</mark> (<mark>SUMO2</mark>) overexpression was investigated.
H9c2 cell morphology was identified as classical long shuttle type by optical microscopy.
The viability of HG-injured H9c2 cells was evaluated by a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and the results indicated that viability was inhibited in a dose-dependent (5.6, 10, 20 and 30 mmol/l) and time-dependent (6, 12 and 24 h) manner.
H9c2 cells treated with 20 mmol/l HG for 24 h were selected for subsequent experiments due to the extent of injury caused at a low density.
Flow cytometry was conducted to confirm cell cycle arrest between G1/S phases and apoptosis promotion in HG-injured H9c2 cells, and the subsequent alleviating effect of <mark>SUMO2</mark> overexpression on these HG-induced effects.
Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis were performed to detect mRNA and protein expression levels of cell cycle-and apoptosis-associated factors.
The results indicated that the expression ofthe cell cycle-associated factors <mark>CyclinA2</mark> and <mark>C-Myc</mark> was upregulated, and <mark>cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a</mark> was downregulated.
The expression of the apoptosis-associated factor <mark>Bcl-2</mark> was upregulated, while <mark>Bcl-2-associated X</mark> and <mark>caspase-3</mark> expression was downregulated, by <mark>SUMO2</mark> overexpression.
Furthermore, the effect of <mark>SUMO2</mark> overexpression on the <mark>transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta</mark>/<mark>Smad</mark> pathway was also determined using RT-qPCR and western blot analysis.
The results indicated the mRNA and protein levels of <mark>TGF-beta1</mark> and <mark>Smad3</mark> in HG-injured H9c2 cells were significantly decreased following <mark>SUMO2</mark> overexpression.
Thus, the results demonstrated that overexpression of <mark>SUMO2</mark> may alleviate H9c2 cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest and apoptosis promotion induced by HG via regulation of cell cycle- and apoptosis-associated factors, as well as inhibition of the <mark>TGF-beta</mark>/<mark>Smad</mark> pathway.
These results may therefore provide a novel strategy for the protection of cardiomyocytes and may aid the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with DC.
Salidroside Ameliorates Renal Interstitial Fibrosis by Inhibiting the <mark>TLR4</mark>/<mark>NF-kappaB</mark> and <mark>MAPK</mark> Signaling Pathways.
Salidroside (Sal) is an active ingredient that is isolated from Rhodiola rosea, which has been reported to have anti-inflammatory activities and a renal protective effect.
However, the role of Sal on renal fibrosis has not yet been elucidated.
Here, the purpose of the current study is to test the protective effects of Sal against renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF), and to explore the underlying mechanisms using both in vivo and in vitro models.
In this study, we establish the unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO) or folic acid (FA)-induced mice renal interstitial fibrosis in vivo and the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-stimulated human proximal tubular epithelial cell (HK-2) model in vitro.
The levels of kidney functional parameters and inflammatory cytokines in serum are examined.
The degree of renal damage and fibrosis is determined by histological assessment.
Immunohistochemistry and western blotting are used to determine the mechanisms of Sal against RIF.
Our results show that treatment with Sal can ameliorate tubular injury and deposition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) components (including <mark>collagen SH</mark> and <mark>collagen I</mark>).
Furthermore, Sal administration significantly suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as evidenced by a decreased expression of <mark>alpha-SMA</mark>, <mark>vimentin</mark>, <mark>TGF-beta1</mark>, <mark>snail</mark>, <mark>slug</mark>, and a largely restored expression of <mark>E-cadherin</mark>.
Additionally, Sal also reduces the levels of serum biochemical markers (serum creatinine, Scr; blood urea nitrogen, BUN; and uric acid, UA) and decreases the release of inflammatory <mark>cytokines</mark> (<mark>IL-1beta</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>).
Further study revealed that the effect of Sal on renal interstitial fibrosis is associated with the lower expression of <mark>TLR4</mark>, p-<mark>IkappaBalpha</mark>, p-<mark>NF-kappaB</mark> and <mark>mitogen-activated protein kinases</mark> (<mark>MAPK</mark>), both in vivo and in vitro.
In conclusion, Sal treatment improves kidney function, ameliorates the deposition of the ECM components and relieves the protein levels of EMT markers in mouse kidneys and HK-2 cells.
Furthermore, Sal treatment significantly decreases the release of inflammatory cytokines and inhibits the <mark>TLR4</mark>/<mark>NF-kappaB</mark> and <mark>MAPK</mark> signaling pathways.
Collectively, these results suggest that the administration of Sal could be a novel therapeutic strategy in treating renal fibrosis.
