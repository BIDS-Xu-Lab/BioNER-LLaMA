<mark>ICSBP</mark> is essential for the development of mouse <mark>type I interferon</mark>-producing cells and for the generation and activation of <mark>CD8alpha</mark>(+) dendritic cells.
<mark>Interferon (IFN) consensus sequence-binding protein</mark> (<mark>ICSBP</mark>) is a <mark>transcription factor</mark> playing a critical role in the regulation of lineage commitment, especially in myeloid cell differentiation.
In this study, we have characterized the phenotype and activation pattern of subsets of dendritic cells (DCs) in <mark>ICSBP</mark>(-/-) mice.
Remarkably, the recently identified mouse <mark>IFN</mark>-producing cells (mIPCs) were absent in all lymphoid organs from <mark>ICSBP</mark>(-/-) mice, as revealed by lack of <mark>CD11c</mark>(low)<mark>B220</mark>(+)<mark>Ly6C</mark>(+)<mark>CD11b</mark>(-) cells.
In parallel, <mark>CD11c</mark>(+) cells isolated from <mark>ICSBP</mark>(-/-) spleens were unable to produce <mark>type I IFNs</mark> in response to viral stimulation.
<mark>ICSBP</mark>(-/-) mice also displayed a marked reduction of the DC subset expressing the <mark>CD8alpha</mark> marker (<mark>CD8alpha</mark>(+) DCs) in spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus.
Moreover, <mark>ICSBP</mark>(-/-) <mark>CD8alpha</mark>(+) DCs exhibited a markedly impaired phenotype when compared with WT DCs.
They expressed very low levels of costimulatory molecules (<mark>intercellular adhesion molecule [ICAM]-1</mark>, <mark>CD40</mark>, <mark>CD80</mark>, <mark>CD86</mark>) and of the T cell area-homing <mark>chemokine receptor</mark> <mark>CCR7</mark>, whereas they showed higher levels of <mark>CCR2</mark> and <mark>CCR6</mark>, as revealed by reverse transcription PCR.
In addition, these cells were unable to undergo full phenotypic activation upon in vitro culture in presence of maturation stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide or poly (I:C), which paralleled with lack of <mark>Toll-like receptor (TLR)3</mark> mRNA expression.
Finally, <mark>cytokine</mark> expression pattern was also altered in <mark>ICSBP</mark>(-/-) DCs, as they did not express <mark>interleukin (IL)-12p40</mark> or <mark>IL-15</mark>, but they displayed detectable <mark>IL-4</mark> mRNA levels.
On the whole, these results indicate that <mark>ICSBP</mark> is a crucial factor in the regulation of two possibly linked processes: (a) the development and activity of mIPCs, whose lack in <mark>ICSBP</mark>(-/-) mice may explain their high susceptibility to virus infections; (b) the generation and activation of <mark>CD8alpha</mark>(+) DCs, whose impairment in <mark>ICSBP</mark>(-/-) mice can be responsible for the defective generation of a Th1 type of immune response.
<mark>Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase-2</mark> gene: structure and transcriptional regulation of the human gene.
The <mark>sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases</mark> (<mark>SERCAs</mark>) belong to a family of active calcium transport enzymes encoded by the <mark>SERCA1, 2, and 3</mark> genes.
In this study, we describe the complete structure of the human <mark>SERCA2</mark> gene and its 5 -regulatory region.
The <mark>hSERCA2</mark> gene is located in chromosome 12 position q24.1 in Contig NT_009770.8, spans 70 kb, and is organized in 21 exons intervened by 20 introns.
The last two exons of the pre-mRNA produce by alternatively splicing the cardiac/slow-twitch muscle-specific <mark>SERCA2a</mark> isoform and the ubiquitous <mark>SERCA2b</mark> isoform.
The sequence of the proximal 225-bp regulatory region of the <mark>SERCA2</mark> genes is 80% G+C-rich and is conserved among human, rabbit, rat, and mouse species.
It contains a TATA-like-box, an E-box/USF sequence, a CAAT-box, four <mark>Sp1</mark> binding sites, and a thyroid hormone responsive element (TRE).
There are two other conserved regulatory regions located between positions -410 to -661 bp and from -919 to -1410 bp.
Among the DNA cis-elements present in these two regulatory regions there are potential binding sites for: <mark>GATA-4, -5, -6</mark>, <mark>Nkx-2.5</mark>/<mark>Csx</mark>, <mark>OTF-1</mark>, <mark>USF</mark>, <mark>MEF-2</mark>, <mark>SRF</mark>, <mark>PPAR</mark>/<mark>RXR</mark>, <mark>AP-2</mark>, and TREs.
Upstream from position -1.5 kb, there is no significant homology among the <mark>SERCA2</mark> genes cloned.
In addition, the human gene has several repeated sequences mainly of the Alu and L2 type located upstream from position -1.7 kb, spanning in a continuous fashion for more than 40 kb.
In this study, we report the cloning of 2.4 kb of 5-regulatory region and demonstrate that the proximal promoter region is sufficient for expression in cardiac myocytes, and the region from -225 to -1232 bp contains regulatory DNA elements which down-regulate the expression of the <mark>SERCA2</mark> gene in neonatal cardiomyocytes.
Human <mark>growth hormone</mark> (<mark>GH1</mark>) gene polymorphism map in a normal-statured adult population.
OBJECTIVE: <mark>GH1</mark> gene presents a complex map of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the entire promoter, coding and noncoding regions.
The aim of the study was to establish the complete map of <mark>GH1</mark> gene SNPs in our control normal population and to analyse its association with adult height.
DESIGN, SUBJECTS AND MEASUREMENTS: A systematic <mark>GH1</mark> gene analysis was designed in a control population of 307 adults of both sexes with height normally distributed within normal range for the same population: -2 standard deviation scores (SDS) to +2 SDS.
An analysis was performed on individual and combined genotype associations with adult height.
RESULTS: Twenty-five SNPs presented a frequency over 1%: 11 in the promoter (P1 to P11), three in the 5'UTR region (P12 to P14), one in exon 1 (P15), three in intron 1 (P16 to P18), two in intron 2 (P19 and P20), two in exon 4 (P21 and P22) and three in intron 4 (P23 to P25).
Twenty-nine additional changes with frequencies under 1% were found in 29 subjects.
P8, P19, P20 and P25 had not been previously described.
P6, P12, P17 and P25 accounted for 6.2% of the variation in adult height (P = 0.0007) in this population with genotypes A/G at P6, G/G at P6 and A/G at P12 decreasing height SDS (-0.063 +/- 0.031, -0.693 +/- 0.350 and -0.489 +/- 0.265, Mean +/- SE) and genotypes A/T at P17 and T/G at P25 increasing height SDS (+1.094 +/- 0.456 and +1.184 +/- 0.432).
CONCLUSIONS: This study established the <mark>GH1</mark> gene sequence variation map in a normal adult height control population confirming the high density of SNPs in a relatively small gene.
Our study shows that the more frequent SNPs did not significantly contribute to height determination, while only one promoter and two intronic SNPs contributed significantly to it.
Studies in larger populations will have to confirm the associations and in vitro functional studies will elucidate the mechanisms involved.
Systematic <mark>GH1</mark> gene analysis in patients with growth delay and suspected GH deficiency/insufficiency will clarify whether different SNP frequencies and/or the presence of different sequence changes may be associated with phenotypes in them.
Increased proinflammatory endothelial response to <mark>S100A8/A9</mark> after preactivation through advanced glycation end products.
BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease in which a perpetuated activation of <mark>NFkappaB</mark> via the <mark>RAGE</mark> (<mark>receptor for advanced glycation end products</mark>)-<mark>MAPK</mark> signalling pathway may play an important pathogenetic role.
As recently <mark>S100 proteins</mark> have been identified as ligands of <mark>RAGE</mark>, we sought to determine the effects of the proinflammatory heterodimer of <mark>S100A8</mark>/<mark>S100A9</mark> on the <mark>RAGE</mark>-<mark>NFkappaB</mark> mediated induction of proinflammatory gene expression.
METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were preincubated for 72 h with <mark>AGE</mark>-<mark>albumin</mark> or unmodified albumin for control, whereas <mark>AGE</mark>-<mark>albumin</mark> induction resulted in an upregulation of <mark>RAGE</mark>.
Following this preactivation, cells were stimulated for 48 h with heterodimeric human recombinant <mark>S100A8</mark>/<mark>S100A9</mark>.
RESULTS: Heterodimeric <mark>S100A8</mark>/<mark>S100A9</mark> enhanced secretion of <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>ICAM-1</mark>, <mark>VCAM-1</mark> and <mark>MCP1</mark> in <mark>AGE</mark>-<mark>albumin</mark> pretreated HUVEC in a dose dependent manner.
These effects could not be detected after stimulation with the homodimeric proteins <mark>S100A8</mark>, <mark>S100A9</mark>, <mark>S100A1</mark> and <mark>S100B</mark>.
The effects of heterodimeric <mark>S100A8</mark>/<mark>S100A9</mark> were reduced by inhibition of the <mark>MAP-kinase</mark> pathways <mark>ERK1/2</mark> and <mark>p38</mark> by PD 98059 and SB 203580, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The heterodimeric <mark>S100A8</mark>/<mark>S100A9</mark> might therefore play a hitherto unknown role in triggering atherosclerosis in diabetes and renal failure, pathophysiological entities associated with a high AGE burden.
Thus, blocking heterodimeric <mark>S100A8</mark>/<mark>S100A9</mark> might represent a novel therapeutic modality in treating atherosclerosis.
Frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes regulating inflammatory responses in a community-based population.
BACKGROUND: Allele frequencies reported from public databases or articles are mostly based on small sample sizes.
Differences in genotype frequencies by age, race and sex have implications for studies designed to examine genetic susceptibility to disease.
In a community-based cohort of 9,960 individuals, we compared the allele frequencies of 49 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes involved in inflammatory pathways to the frequencies reported on public databases, and examined the genotypes frequencies by age and sex.
The genes in which SNPs were analyzed include <mark>CCR2</mark>, <mark>CCR5</mark>, <mark>COX1</mark>, <mark>COX2</mark>, <mark>CRP</mark>, <mark>CSF1</mark>, <mark>CSF2</mark>, <mark>IFNG</mark>, <mark>IL1A</mark>, <mark>IL1B</mark>, <mark>IL2</mark>, <mark>IL4</mark>, <mark>IL6</mark>, <mark>IL8</mark>, <mark>IL10</mark>, <mark>IL13</mark>, <mark>IL18</mark>, <mark>LTA</mark>, <mark>MPO</mark>, <mark>NOS2A</mark>, <mark>NOS3</mark>, <mark>PPARD</mark>, <mark>PPARG</mark>, <mark>PPARGC1</mark> and <mark>TNF</mark>.
RESULTS: Mean(SD) age was 53.2(15.5); 98% were Caucasians and 62% were women.
Only 1 out of 33 SNPs differed from the SNP500Cancer database in allele frequency by &gt;10% in Caucasians (n = 9,831), whereas 12 SNPs differed by &gt;10% (up to 50%) in African Americans (n = 105).
Two out of 15 SNPs differed from the dbSNP database in allele frequencies by &gt;10% in Caucasians, and 5 out of 15 SNPs differed by &gt;10% in African Americans.
Age was similar across most genotype groups.
Genotype frequencies did not differ by sex except for <mark>TNF</mark>(rs1799724), <mark>IL2</mark>(rs2069762), <mark>IL10</mark>(rs1800890), <mark>PPARG</mark>(rs1801282), and <mark>CRP</mark>(rs1800947) with differences of less than 4%.
CONCLUSION: When estimating the size of samples needed for a study, particularly if a reference sample is used, one should take into consideration the size and ethnicity of the reference sample.
Larger sample size is needed for public databases that report allele frequencies in non-Caucasian populations.
Regulatory network of inflammation downstream of <mark>proteinase-activated receptors</mark>.
BACKGROUND: <mark>Protease-activated receptors</mark> (<mark>PAR</mark>) are present in the urinary bladder, and their expression is altered in response to inflammation.
PARs are a unique class of G protein-coupled that carry their own ligands, which remain cryptic until unmasked by proteolytic cleavage.
Although the canonical signal transduction pathway downstream of <mark>PAR</mark> activation and coupling with various <mark>G proteins</mark> is known and leads to the rapid transcription of genes involved in inflammation, the effect of <mark>PAR</mark> activation on the downstream transcriptome is unknown.
We have shown that intravesical administration of <mark>PAR</mark>-activating peptides leads to an inflammatory reaction characterized by edema and granulocyte infiltration.
Moreover, the inflammatory response to intravesical instillation of known pro-inflammatory stimuli such as E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), substance P (SP), and antigen was strongly attenuated by <mark>PAR1</mark>- and to a lesser extent by <mark>PAR2</mark>-deficiency.
RESULTS: Here, cDNA array experiments determined inflammatory genes whose expression is dependent on <mark>PAR1</mark> activation.
For this purpose, we compared the alteration in gene expression in wild type and <mark>PAR1</mark>-/- mice induced by classical pro-inflammatory stimuli (LPS, SP, and antigen).
75 transcripts were considered to be dependent on <mark>PAR-1</mark> activation and further annotated in silico by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) and gene ontology (GO).
Selected transcripts were target validated by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR).
Among <mark>PAR1</mark>-dependent transcripts, the following have been implicated in the inflammatory process: <mark>b2m</mark>, <mark>ccl7</mark>, <mark>cd200</mark>, <mark>cd63</mark>, <mark>cdbpd</mark>, <mark>cfl1</mark>, <mark>dusp1</mark>, <mark>fkbp1a</mark>, <mark>fth1</mark>, <mark>hspb1</mark>, <mark>marcksl1</mark>, <mark>mmp2</mark>, <mark>myo5a</mark>, <mark>nfkbia</mark>, <mark>pax1</mark>, <mark>plaur</mark>, <mark>ppia</mark>, <mark>ptpn1</mark>, <mark>ptprcap</mark>, <mark>s100a10</mark>, <mark>sim2</mark>, and <mark>tnfaip2</mark>.
However, a balanced response to signals of injury requires a transient cellular activation of a panel of genes together with inhibitory systems that temper the overwhelming inflammation.
In this context, the activation of genes such as <mark>dusp1</mark> and <mark>nfkbia</mark> seems to counter-balance the inflammatory response to <mark>PAR</mark> activation by limiting prolonged activation of <mark>p38 MAPK</mark> and increased cytokine production.
In contrast, transcripts such as <mark>arf6</mark> and <mark>dcnt1</mark> that are involved in the mechanism of <mark>PAR</mark> re-sensitization would tend to perpetuate the inflammatory reaction in response to common pro-inflammatory stimuli.
CONCLUSION: The combination of cDNA array results and genomic networks reveals an overriding participation of <mark>PAR1</mark> in bladder inflammation, provides a working model for the involvement of downstream signaling, and evokes testable hypotheses regarding the transcriptome downstream of <mark>PAR1</mark> activation.
It remains to be determined whether or not mechanisms targeting <mark>PAR1</mark> gene silencing or <mark>PAR1</mark> blockade will ameliorate the clinical manifestation of cystitis.
<mark>echinus</mark>, required for interommatidial cell sorting and cell death in the Drosophila pupal retina, encodes a protein with homology to <mark>ubiquitin-specific proteases</mark>.
BACKGROUND: Programmed cell death is used to remove excess cells between ommatidia in the Drosophila pupal retina.
This death is required to establish the crystalline, hexagonal packing of ommatidia that characterizes the adult fly eye.
In previously described <mark>echinus</mark> mutants, interommatidial cell sorting, which precedes cell death, occurred relatively normally.
Interommatidial cell death was partially suppressed, resulting in adult eyes that contained excess pigment cells, and in which ommatidia were mildly disordered.
These results have suggested that <mark>echinus</mark> functions in the pupal retina primarily to promote interommatidial cell death.
RESULTS: We generated a number of new <mark>echinus</mark> alleles, some likely null mutants.
Analysis of these alleles provides evidence that <mark>echinus</mark> has roles in cell sorting as well as cell death.
<mark>echinus</mark> encodes a protein with homology to <mark>ubiquitin-specific proteases</mark>.
These proteins cleave <mark>ubiquitin-conjugated proteins</mark> at the <mark>ubiquitin</mark> C-terminus.
The <mark>echinus</mark> locus encodes multiple splice forms, including two proteins that lack residues thought to be critical for deubiquitination activity.
Surprisingly, ubiquitous expression in the eye of versions of <mark>Echinus</mark> that lack residues critical for <mark>ubiquitin specific protease</mark> activity, as well as a version predicted to be functional, rescue the <mark>echinus</mark> loss-of-function phenotype.
Finally, genetic interactions were not detected between <mark>echinus</mark> loss and gain-of-function and a number of known apoptotic regulators.
These include <mark>Notch</mark>, <mark>EGFR</mark>, the <mark>caspases</mark> <mark>Dronc</mark>, <mark>Drice</mark>, <mark>Dcp-1</mark>, <mark>Dream</mark>, the <mark>caspase</mark> activators, <mark>Rpr</mark>, <mark>Hid</mark>, and <mark>Grim</mark>, the <mark>caspase</mark> inhibitor <mark>DIAP1</mark>, and <mark>Lozenge</mark> or <mark>Klumpfuss</mark>.
CONCLUSION: The <mark>echinus</mark> locus encodes multiple splice forms of a protein with homology to <mark>ubiquitin-specific proteases</mark>, but protease activity is unlikely to be required for <mark>echinus</mark> function, at least when <mark>echinus</mark> is overexpressed.
Characterization of likely <mark>echinus</mark> null alleles and genetic interactions suggests that <mark>echinus</mark> acts at a novel point(s) to regulate interommatidial cell sorting and/or cell death in the fly eye.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae <mark>HMO1</mark> interacts with <mark>TFIID</mark> and participates in start site selection by <mark>RNA polymerase II</mark>.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae <mark>HMO1</mark>, a <mark>high mobility group B (HMGB) protein</mark>, associates with the rRNA locus and with the promoters of many <mark>ribosomal protein genes</mark> (<mark>RPGs</mark>).
Here, the <mark>Sos</mark> recruitment system was used to show that <mark>HMO1</mark> interacts with <mark>TBP</mark> and <mark>the N-terminal domain</mark> (<mark>TAND</mark>) of <mark>TAF1</mark>, which are integral components of <mark>TFIID</mark>.
Biochemical studies revealed that <mark>HMO1</mark> copurifies with <mark>TFIID</mark> and directly interacts with <mark>TBP</mark> but not with <mark>TAND</mark>.
Deletion of <mark>HMO1</mark> (Delta<mark>hmo1</mark>) causes a severe cold-sensitive growth defect and decreases transcription of some <mark>TAND</mark>-dependent genes.
Delta<mark>hmo1</mark> also affects <mark>TFIID</mark> occupancy at some <mark>RPG</mark> promoters in a promoter-specific manner.
Interestingly, over-expression of <mark>HMO1</mark> delays colony formation of <mark>taf1</mark> mutants lacking <mark>TAND</mark> (<mark>taf1</mark>Delta<mark>TAND</mark>), but not of the wild-type strain, indicating a functional link between <mark>HMO1</mark> and <mark>TAND</mark>.
Furthermore, Delta<mark>hmo1</mark> exhibits synthetic growth defects in some <mark>spt15</mark> (<mark>TBP</mark>) and <mark>toa1</mark> (<mark>TFIIA</mark>) mutants while it rescues growth defects of some <mark>sua7</mark> (<mark>TFIIB</mark>) mutants.
Importantly, Delta<mark>hmo1</mark> causes an upstream shift in transcriptional start sites of <mark>RPS5</mark>, <mark>RPS16A</mark>, <mark>RPL23B</mark>, <mark>RPL27B</mark> and <mark>RPL32</mark>, but not of <mark>RPS31</mark>, <mark>RPL10</mark>, <mark>TEF2</mark> and <mark>ADH1</mark>, indicating that <mark>HMO1</mark> may participate in start site selection of a subset of class II genes presumably via its interaction with <mark>TFIID</mark>.
<mark>NF-kappa B</mark> genes have a major role in inflammatory breast cancer.
BACKGROUND: IBC (Inflammatory Breast cancer) is a rare form of breast cancer with a particular phenotype.
New molecular targets are needed to improve the treatment of this rapidly fatal disease.
Given the role of <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>-related genes in cell proliferation, invasiveness, angiogenesis and inflammation, we postulated that they might be deregulated in IBC.
METHODS: We measured the mRNA expression levels of 60 <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>-related genes by using real-time quantitative RT-PCR in a well-defined series of 35 IBCs, by comparison with 22 stage IIB and III non inflammatory breast cancers.
Twenty-four distant metastases of breast cancer served as "poor prognosis" breast tumor controls.
RESULTS: Thirty-five (58%) of the 60 <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>-related genes were significantly upregulated in IBC compared with non IBC.
The upregulated genes were <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> genes (<mark>NFKB1</mark>, <mark>RELA</mark>, <mark>IKBKG</mark>, <mark>NFKBIB</mark>, <mark>NFKB2</mark>, <mark>REL</mark>, <mark>CHUK</mark>), apoptosis genes (<mark>MCL1L</mark>, <mark>TNFAIP3</mark>/<mark>A20</mark>, <mark>GADD45B</mark>, <mark>FASLG</mark>, <mark>MCL1S</mark>, <mark>IER3L</mark>, <mark>TNFRSF10B</mark>/<mark>TRAILR2</mark>), immune response genes (<mark>CD40</mark>, <mark>CD48</mark>, <mark>TNFSF11</mark>/<mark>RANKL</mark>, <mark>TNFRSF11A</mark>/<mark>RANK</mark>, <mark>CCL2</mark>/<mark>MCP-1</mark>, <mark>CD40LG</mark>, <mark>IL15</mark>, <mark>GBP1</mark>), proliferation genes (<mark>CCND2</mark>, <mark>CCND3</mark>, <mark>CSF1R</mark>, <mark>CSF1</mark>, <mark>SOD2</mark>), tumor-promoting genes (<mark>CXCL12</mark>, <mark>SELE</mark>, <mark>TNC</mark>, <mark>VCAM1</mark>, <mark>ICAM1</mark>, <mark>PLAU</mark>/<mark>UPA</mark>) or angiogenesis genes (<mark>PTGS2</mark>/<mark>COX2</mark>, <mark>CXCL1</mark>/<mark>GRO1</mark>).
Only two of these 35 genes (<mark>PTGS2</mark>/<mark>COX2</mark> and <mark>CXCL1</mark>/<mark>GRO1</mark>)were also upregulated in breast cancer metastases.
We identified a five-gene molecular signature that matched patient outcomes, consisting of <mark>IL8</mark> and <mark>VEGF</mark> plus three <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>-unrelated genes that we had previously identified as prognostic markers in the same series of IBC.
CONCLUSION: The <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> pathway appears to play a major role in IBC, possibly contributing to the unusual phenotype and aggressiveness of this form of breast cancer.
Some upregulated <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>-related genes might serve as novel therapeutic targets in IBC.
<mark>Plx1</mark> is required for chromosomal DNA replication under stressful conditions.
<mark>Polo-like kinase</mark> <mark>(Plk)1</mark> is required for mitosis progression.
However, although <mark>Plk1</mark> is expressed throughout the cell cycle, its function during S-phase is unknown.
Using Xenopus laevis egg extracts, we demonstrate that <mark>Plx1</mark>, the Xenopus orthologue of <mark>Plk1</mark>, is required for DNA replication in the presence of stalled replication forks induced by aphidicolin, etoposide or reduced levels of DNA-bound <mark>Mcm complexes</mark>.
<mark>Plx1</mark> binds to chromatin and suppresses the <mark>ATM</mark>/<mark>ATR</mark>-dependent intra-S-phase checkpoint that inhibits origin firing.
This allows <mark>Cdc45</mark> loading and derepression of DNA replication initiation.
Checkpoint activation increases <mark>Plx1</mark> binding to the <mark>Mcm complex</mark> through its <mark>Polo box domain</mark>.
<mark>Plx1</mark> recruitment to chromatin is independent of checkpoint mediators <mark>Tipin</mark> and <mark>Claspin</mark>.
Instead, <mark>ATR</mark>-dependent phosphorylation of serine 92 of <mark>Mcm2</mark> is required for the recruitment of <mark>Plx1</mark> to chromatin and for the recovery of DNA replication under stress.
Depletion of <mark>Plx1</mark> leads to accumulation of chromosomal breakage that is prevented by the addition of recombinant <mark>Plx1</mark>.
These data suggest that <mark>Plx1</mark> promotes genome stability by regulating DNA replication under stressful conditions.
<mark>Bone morphogenetic protein-4</mark> interacts with <mark>activin</mark> and <mark>GnRH</mark> to modulate <mark>gonadotrophin</mark> secretion in LbetaT2 gonadotrophs.
We have shown previously that, in sheep primary pituitary cells, <mark>bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP)-4</mark> inhibits <mark>FSHbeta</mark> mRNA expression and <mark>FSH</mark> release.
In contrast, in mouse LbetaT2 gonadotrophs, others have shown a stimulatory effect of <mark>BMPs</mark> on basal or <mark>activin</mark>-stimulated <mark>FSHbeta</mark> promoter-driven transcription.
As a species comparison with our previous results, we used LbetaT2 cells to investigate the effects of <mark>BMP-4</mark> on <mark>gonadotrophin</mark> mRNA and secretion modulated by <mark>activin</mark> and <mark>GnRH</mark>.
<mark>BMP-4</mark> alone had no effect on <mark>FSH</mark> production, but enhanced the <mark>activin</mark>+<mark>GnRH</mark>-induced stimulation of <mark>FSHbeta</mark> mRNA and <mark>FSH</mark> secretion, without any effect on <mark>follistatin</mark> mRNA.
<mark>BMP-4</mark> reduced <mark>LHbeta</mark> mRNA up-regulation in response to <mark>GnRH</mark> (+/-<mark>activin</mark>) and decreased <mark>GnRH receptor</mark> expression, which would favour <mark>FSH</mark>, rather than <mark>LH</mark>, synthesis and secretion.
In contrast to sheep pituitary gonadotrophs, which express only <mark>BMP receptor types IA (BMPRIA) and II (BMPRII)</mark>, LbetaT2 cells also express <mark>BMPRIB</mark>.
<mark>Smad1/5</mark> phosphorylation induced by <mark>BMP-4</mark>, indicating activation of <mark>BMP</mark> signalling, was the same whether <mark>BMP-4</mark> was used alone or combined with <mark>activin</mark>+/-<mark>GnRH</mark>.
We hypothesized that <mark>activin</mark> and/or <mark>GnRH</mark> pathways may be modulated by <mark>BMP-4</mark>, but neither the <mark>activin</mark>-stimulated phosphorylation of <mark>Smad2/3</mark> nor the <mark>GnRH</mark>-induced <mark>ERK1/2</mark> or <mark>cAMP response element-binding</mark> phosphorylation were modified.
However, the <mark>GnRH</mark>-induced activation of <mark>p38 MAPK</mark> was decreased by <mark>BMP-4</mark>.
This was associated with increased <mark>FSHbeta</mark> mRNA levels and <mark>FSH</mark> secretion, but decreased <mark>LHbeta</mark> mRNA levels.
These results confirm 1.
<mark>BMPs</mark> as important modulators of <mark>activin</mark> and/or <mark>GnRH</mark>-stimulated <mark>gonadotrophin</mark> synthesis and release and 2.
important species differences in these effects, which could relate to differences in <mark>BMP receptor</mark> expression in gonadotrophs.
Plasma <mark>IP-10</mark>, apoptotic and angiogenic factors associated with fatal cerebral malaria in India.
BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum in a subset of patients can lead to cerebral malaria (CM), a major contributor to malaria-associated mortality.
Despite treatment, CM mortality can be as high as 30%, while 10% of survivors of the disease may experience short- and long-term neurological complications.
The pathogenesis of CM is mediated by alterations in cytokine and chemokine homeostasis, inflammation as well as vascular injury and repair processes although their roles are not fully understood.
The hypothesis for this study is that CM-induced changes in inflammatory, apoptotic and angiogenic factors mediate severity of CM and that their identification will enable development of new prognostic markers and adjunctive therapies for preventing CM mortalities.
METHODS: Plasma samples (133) were obtained from healthy controls (HC, 25), mild malaria (MM, 48), cerebral malaria survivors (CMS, 48), and cerebral malaria non-survivors (CMNS, 12) at admission to the hospital in Jabalpur, India.
Plasma levels of 30 biomarkers ((<mark>IL-1beta</mark>, <mark>IL-1ra</mark>, <mark>IL-2</mark>, <mark>IL-4</mark>, <mark>IL-5</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-8</mark>, <mark>IL-9</mark>, <mark>IL-10</mark>, <mark>IL-12 (p70)</mark>, <mark>IL-13</mark>, <mark>IL-15</mark>, <mark>IL-17</mark>, <mark>Eotaxin</mark>, <mark>FGF basic protein</mark>, <mark>G-CSF</mark>, <mark>GM-CSF</mark>, <mark>IFN-gamma</mark>, <mark>IP-10</mark>, <mark>MCP-1</mark> (<mark>MCAF</mark>), <mark>MIP-1alpha</mark>, <mark>MIP-1beta</mark>, <mark>RANTES</mark>, <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>, <mark>Fas-ligand</mark> (<mark>Fas-L</mark>), soluble <mark>Fas</mark> (s<mark>Fas</mark>), soluble <mark>TNF receptor 1</mark> (s<mark>TNF-R1</mark>) and soluble <mark>TNF receptor 2</mark> (s<mark>TNFR-2</mark>), <mark>PDGF bb</mark> and <mark>VEGF</mark>)) were simultaneously measured in an initial subset of ten samples from each group.
Only those biomarkers which showed significant differences in the pilot analysis were chosen for testing on all remaining samples.
The results were then compared between the four groups to determine their role in CM severity.
RESULTS: <mark>IP-10</mark>, s<mark>TNF-R2</mark> and s<mark>Fas</mark> were independently associated with increased risk of CM associated mortality.
CMNS patients had a significantly lower level of the neuroprotective factor <mark>VEGF</mark> when compared to other groups (P &lt; 0.0045).
The ratios of <mark>VEGF</mark> to <mark>IP-10</mark>, s<mark>TNF-R2</mark>, and s<mark>Fas</mark> distinguished CM survivors from non survivors (P &lt; 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that plasma levels of <mark>IP-10</mark>, s<mark>TNF-R2</mark> and s<mark>Fas</mark> may be potential biomarkers of CM severity and mortality.
<mark>VEGF</mark> was found to be protective against CM associated mortality and may be considered for adjunctive therapy to improve the treatment outcome in CM patients.
Effects of common germline genetic variation in cell cycle control genes on breast cancer survival: results from a population-based cohort.
INTRODUCTION: Somatic alterations have been shown to correlate with breast cancer prognosis and survival, but less is known about the effects of common inherited genetic variation.
Of particular interest are genes involved in cell cycle pathways, which regulate cell division.
METHODS: We examined associations between common germline genetic variation in 13 genes involved in cell cycle control (<mark>CCND1</mark>, <mark>CCND2</mark>, <mark>CCND3</mark>, <mark>CCNE1</mark>, <mark>CDK2 [p33]</mark>, <mark>CDK4</mark>, <mark>CDK6</mark>, <mark>CDKN1A</mark> [<mark>p21</mark>, <mark>Cip1</mark>], <mark>CDKN1B</mark> [<mark>p27, Kip1</mark>], <mark>CDKN2A</mark> [<mark>p16</mark>], <mark>CDKN2B</mark> [<mark>p15</mark>], <mark>CDKN2C</mark> [<mark>p18</mark>], and <mark>CDKN2D</mark> [<mark>p19</mark>]) and survival among women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer participating in the SEARCH (Studies of Epidemiology and Risk factors in Cancer Heredity) breast cancer study.
DNA from up to 4,470 women was genotyped for 85 polymorphisms that tag the known common polymorphisms (minor allele frequency &gt; 0.05) in the genes.
The genotypes of each polymorphism were tested for association with survival using Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: The rare allele of the tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2479717 is associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio = 1.26 per rare allele carried, 95% confidence interval: 1.12 to 1.42; P = 0.0001), which was not attenuated after adjusting for tumour stage, grade, and treatment.
This SNP is part of a large linkage disequilibrium block, which contains <mark>CCND3</mark>, <mark>BYSL</mark>, <mark>TRFP</mark>, <mark>USP49</mark>, <mark>C6ofr49</mark>, <mark>FRS3</mark>, and <mark>PGC</mark>.
We evaluated the association of survival and somatic expression of these genes in breast tumours using expression microarray data from seven published datasets.
Elevated expression of the <mark>C6orf49</mark> transcript was associated with breast cancer survival, adding biological interest to the finding.
CONCLUSION: It is possible that <mark>CCND3</mark> rs2479717, or another variant it tags, is associated with prognosis after a diagnosis of breast cancer.
Further study is required to validate this finding.
Curcumin decreases <mark>specificity protein</mark> expression in bladder cancer cells.
Curcumin is the active component of tumeric, and this polyphenolic compound has been extensively investigated as an anticancer drug that modulates multiple pathways and genes.
In this study, 10 to 25 micromol/L curcumin inhibited 253JB-V and KU7 bladder cancer cell growth, and this was accompanied by induction of apoptosis and decreased expression of the <mark>proapoptotic protein</mark> <mark>survivin</mark> and the <mark>angiogenic proteins</mark>
<mark>vascular endothelial growth factor</mark> (<mark>VEGF</mark>) and <mark>VEGF receptor 1</mark> (<mark>VEGFR1</mark>).
Because expression of <mark>survivin,</mark> <mark>VEGF</mark>, and <mark>VEGFR1</mark> are dependent on <mark>specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors</mark>, we also investigated the effects of curcumin on <mark>Sp protein</mark> expression as an underlying mechanism for the apoptotic and antiangiogenic activity of this compound.
The results show that curcumin induced <mark>proteasome</mark>-dependent down-regulation of <mark>Sp1</mark>, <mark>Sp3</mark>, and <mark>Sp4</mark> in 253JB-V and KU7 cells.
Moreover, using RNA interference with small inhibitory RNAs for <mark>Sp1</mark>, <mark>Sp3</mark>, and <mark>Sp4</mark>, we observed that curcumin-dependent inhibition of <mark>nuclear factor kappaB</mark> (<mark>NF-kappaB</mark>)-dependent genes, such as <mark>bcl-2</mark>, <mark>survivin</mark>, and <mark>cyclin D1</mark>, was also due, in part, to loss of <mark>Sp</mark> proteins.
Curcumin also decreased bladder tumor growth in athymic nude mice bearing KU7 cells as xenografts and this was accompanied by decreased <mark>Sp1</mark>, <mark>Sp3</mark>, and <mark>Sp4</mark> protein levels in tumors.
These results show for the first time that one of the underlying mechanisms of action of curcumin as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent is due, in part, to decreased expression of <mark>Sp transcription factors</mark> in bladder cancer cells.
Transcriptional profiling in C. elegans suggests DNA damage dependent apoptosis as an ancient function of the <mark>p53 family</mark>.
BACKGROUND: In contrast to the three mammalian <mark>p53 family</mark> members, <mark>p53</mark>, which is generally involved in DNA damage responses, and <mark>p63</mark> and <mark>p73</mark> which are primarily needed for developmental regulation, <mark>cep-1</mark> encodes for the single C. elegans <mark>p53-like</mark> gene.
<mark>cep-1</mark> acts as a transcription activator in a primordial <mark>p53</mark> pathway that involves <mark>CEP-1</mark> activation and the <mark>CEP-1</mark> dependent transcriptional induction of the worm BH3 only domain encoding genes <mark>egl-1</mark> and <mark>ced-13</mark> to induce germ cell apoptosis.
<mark>EGL-1</mark> and <mark>CED-13</mark> proteins inactivate Bcl-2 like <mark>CED-9</mark> to trigger <mark>CED-4</mark> and <mark>CED-3 caspase</mark> dependent germ cell apoptosis.
To address the function of <mark>p53</mark> in global transcriptional regulation we investigate genome-wide transcriptional responses upon DNA damage and <mark>cep-1</mark> deficiency.
RESULTS: Examining C. elegans expression profiles using whole genome Affymetrix GeneChip arrays, we found that 83 genes were induced more than two fold upon ionizing radiation (IR).
None of these genes, with exception of an ATP ribosylase homolog, encode for known DNA repair genes.
Using two independent <mark>cep-1</mark> loss of function alleles we did not find genes regulated by <mark>cep-1</mark> in the absence of IR.
Among the IR-induced genes only three are dependent on <mark>cep-1</mark>, namely <mark>egl-1</mark>, <mark>ced-13</mark> and a novel C. elegans specific gene.
The majority of IR-induced genes appear to be involved in general stress responses, and qRT-PCR experiments indicate that they are mainly expressed in somatic tissues.
Interestingly, we reveal an extensive overlap of gene expression changes occurring in response to DNA damage and in response to bacterial infection.
Furthermore, many genes induced by IR are also transcriptionally regulated in longevity mutants suggesting that DNA damage and aging induce an overlapping stress response.
CONCLUSION: We performed genome-wide gene expression analyses which indicate that only a surprisingly small number of genes are regulated by <mark>CEP-1</mark> and that DNA damage induced apoptosis via the transcriptional induction of BH3 domain proteins is likely to be an ancient DNA damage response function of the <mark>p53 family</mark>.
Interestingly, although the apoptotic response to DNA damage is regulated through the transcriptional activity of <mark>CEP-1</mark>, other DNA damage responses do not appear to be regulated on the transcriptional level and do not require the <mark>p53 like</mark> gene <mark>cep-1</mark>.
Androgen regulation of the <mark>androgen receptor</mark> coregulators.
BACKGROUND: The critical role of the <mark>androgen receptor</mark> (<mark>AR</mark>) in the development of prostate cancer is well recognized.
The transcriptional activity of <mark>AR</mark> is partly regulated by coregulatory proteins.
It has been suggested that these coregulators could also be important in the progression of prostate cancer.
The aim of this study was to identify coregulators whose expression is regulated by either the androgens and/or by the expression level of <mark>AR</mark>.
METHODS: We used empty vector and <mark>AR</mark> cDNA-transfected LNCaP cells (LNCaP-pcDNA3.1, and LNCaP-<mark>AR</mark>hi, respectively), and grew them for 4 and 24 hours in the presence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) at various concentrations.
The expression of 25 <mark>AR</mark> coregulators (<mark>SRC1</mark>, <mark>TIF2</mark>, <mark>PIAS1</mark>, <mark>PIASx</mark>, <mark>ARIP4</mark>, <mark>BRCA1</mark>, <mark>beta-catenin</mark>, <mark>AIB3</mark>, <mark>AIB1</mark>, <mark>CBP</mark>, <mark>STAT1</mark>, <mark>NCoR1</mark>, <mark>AES</mark>, <mark>cyclin D1</mark>, <mark>p300</mark>, <mark>ARA24</mark>, <mark>LSD1</mark>, <mark>BAG1L</mark>, <mark>gelsolin</mark>, <mark>prohibitin</mark>, <mark>JMJD2C</mark>, <mark>JMJD1A</mark>, <mark>MAK</mark>, <mark>PAK6</mark> and <mark>MAGE11</mark>) was then measured by using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR).
RESULTS: Five of the coregulators (<mark>AIB1</mark>, <mark>CBP</mark>, <mark>MAK</mark>, <mark>BRCA1</mark> and <mark>beta-catenin</mark>) showed more than 2-fold induction and 5 others (<mark>cyclin D1</mark>, <mark>gelsolin</mark>, <mark>prohibitin</mark>, <mark>JMJD1A</mark>, and <mark>JMJD2C</mark>) less than 2-fold induction.
Overexpression of <mark>AR</mark> did not affect the expression of the coregulators alone.
However, overexpression of <mark>AR</mark> enhanced the DHT-stimulated expression of <mark>MAK</mark>, <mark>BRCA1</mark>, <mark>AIB1</mark> and <mark>CBP</mark> and reduced the level of expression of <mark>beta-catenin</mark>, <mark>cyclinD1</mark> and <mark>gelsolin</mark>.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we identified 5 coactivators whose expression was induced by androgens suggesting that they could potentiate <mark>AR</mark> signaling.
Overexpression of <mark>AR</mark> seems to sensitize cells for low levels of androgens.
The Drosophila protein palmitoylome: characterizing <mark>palmitoyl-thioesterases</mark> and <mark>DHHC palmitoyl-transferases</mark>.
Palmitoylation is the post-translational addition of a palmitate moiety to a cysteine residue through a covalent thioester bond.
The addition and removal of this modification is controlled by both <mark>palmitoyl acyl-transferases and thioesterases</mark>.
Using bioinformatic analysis, we identified 22 <mark>DHHC family palmitoyl acyl-transferase</mark> homologs in the Drosophila genome.
We used in situ hybridization,RT-PCR, and published FlyAtlas microarray data to characterize the expression patterns of all 22 fly homologs.
Our results indicate that all are expressed genes, but several, including <mark>CG1407</mark>, <mark>CG4676</mark>, <mark>CG5620</mark>, <mark>CG6017</mark>/<mark>dHIP14</mark>, <mark>CG6618</mark>, <mark>CG6627</mark> and <mark>CG17257</mark> appear to be enriched in neural tissues suggesting that they are important for neural function.
Furthermore, we have found that several may be expressed in a sex-specific manner with adult male specific expression of CG4483 and CG17195.
Using tagged versions of the <mark>DHHC genes</mark>, we demonstrate that fly <mark>DHHC proteins</mark> are primarily located in either the Golgi Apparatus or Endoplasmic Reticulum in S2 cells, except for <mark>CG1407</mark>, which was found on the plasma membrane.
We also characterized the subcellular localization and expression of the three known <mark>thioesterases</mark>: <mark>Palmitoyl-protein Thioesterase 1</mark> (<mark>Ppt1</mark>), <mark>Palmitoyl-protein Thioesterase 2</mark> (<mark>Ppt2</mark>)and <mark>Acyl-protein Thioesterase 1</mark> (<mark>APT1</mark>).
Our results indicate that <mark>Ppt1</mark> and <mark>Ppt2</mark> are the major lysosomal thioesterases while <mark>APT1</mark> is the likely cytoplasmic thioesterase.
Finally, in vivo rescue experiments show that Ppt2 expression cannot rescue the neural inclusion phenotypes associated with loss of Ppt1, further supporting distinct functions and substrates for these two thioesterases.
These results will serve as the basis for a more complete understanding of the protein palmitoylome's normal cellular functions in the fly and will lead to further insights into the molecular etiology of diseases associated with the mis-regulation of palmitoylation.
The <mark>Krüppel-like factor 9</mark> (<mark>KLF9</mark>) network in HEC-1-A endometrial carcinoma cells suggests the carcinogenic potential of dys-regulated <mark>KLF9</mark> expression.
BACKGROUND: <mark>Krüppel-like factor 9</mark> (<mark>KLF9</mark>) is a transcriptional regulator of uterine endometrial cell proliferation, adhesion and differentiation; processes essential for pregnancy success and which are subverted during tumorigenesis.
The network of endometrial genes controlled by <mark>KLF9</mark> is largely unknown.
Over-expression of <mark>KLF9</mark> in the human endometrial cancer cell line HEC-1-A alters cell morphology, proliferative indices, and differentiation, when compared to <mark>KLF9</mark> under-expressing HEC-1-A cells.
This cell line provides a unique model for identifying <mark>KLF9</mark> downstream gene targets and signaling pathways.
METHODS: <mark>HEC-1</mark>-A sub-lines differing in relative levels of <mark>KLF9</mark> were subjected to microarray analysis to identify differentially-regulated RNAs.
RESULTS: <mark>KLF9</mark> under-expression induced twenty four genes.
The <mark>KLF9</mark>-suppressed mRNAs encode protein participants in: aldehyde metabolism (<mark>AKR7A2</mark>, <mark>ALDH1A1</mark>); regulation of the <mark>actin</mark> cytoskeleton and cell motility (e.g., <mark>ANK3</mark>, <mark>ITGB8</mark>); cellular detoxification (<mark>SULT1A1</mark>, <mark>ABCC4</mark>); cellular signaling (e.g., <mark>ACBD3</mark>, <mark>FZD5</mark>, <mark>RAB25</mark>, <mark>CALB1</mark>); and transcriptional regulation (<mark>PAX2</mark>, <mark>STAT1</mark>).
Sixty mRNAs were more abundant in <mark>KLF9</mark> over-expressing sub-lines.
The <mark>KLF9</mark>-induced mRNAs encode proteins which participate in: regulation and function of the <mark>actin</mark> cytoskeleton (<mark>COTL1</mark>, <mark>FSCN1</mark>, <mark>FXYD5</mark>, <mark>MYO10</mark>); cell adhesion, extracellular matrix and basement membrane formation (e.g., <mark>AMIGO2</mark>, <mark>COL4A1</mark>, <mark>COL4A2</mark>, <mark>LAMC2</mark>, <mark>NID2</mark>); transport (<mark>CLIC4</mark>); cellular signaling (e.g., <mark>BCAR3</mark>, <mark>MAPKAPK3</mark>); transcriptional regulation [e.g., <mark>KLF4</mark>, <mark>NR3C1</mark> (<mark>glucocorticoid receptor</mark>), <mark>RXRalpha</mark>], growth factor/<mark>cytokine</mark> actions (<mark>SLPI</mark>, <mark>BDNF</mark>); and membrane-associated proteins and receptors (e.g., <mark>CXCR4</mark>, <mark>PTCH1</mark>).
In addition, the abundance of mRNAs that encode hypothetical proteins (<mark>KLF9</mark>-inhibited: <mark>C12orf29</mark> and <mark>C1orf186</mark>; <mark>KLF9</mark>-induced: <mark>C10orf38</mark> and <mark>C9orf167</mark>) were altered by <mark>KLF9</mark> expression.
Human endometrial tumors of high tumor grade had decreased <mark>KLF9</mark> mRNA abundance.
CONCLUSION: <mark>KLF9</mark> influences the expression of uterine epithelial genes through mechanisms likely involving its transcriptional activator and repressor functions and which may underlie altered tumor biology with aberrant <mark>KLF9</mark> expression.
Over-expression of <mark>ubiquitin carboxy terminal hydrolase-L1</mark> induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells.
<mark>Ubiquitin carboxy terminal hydrolase-L1</mark> (<mark>UCH-L1</mark>) belongs to the <mark>UCH proteases family</mark> that deubiquitinates <mark>ubiquitin</mark>-protein conjugates in the <mark>ubiquitin</mark>-proteasome system.
Previous research showed that <mark>UCH-L1</mark> was expressed in mouse retinal cells and testicular germ cells, and its function was associated with apoptosis.
But it is still unclear whether <mark>UCH-L1</mark> is concerned with apoptosis in tumor cells.
In order to clarify the role of <mark>UCH-L1</mark> in tumor cells, multi-drug resistance (MDR) human breast carcinoma cell line MCF7/Adr, that expresses relatively high <mark>UCH-L1</mark>, and its parental cell line MCF7, that expresses relatively low <mark>UCH-L1</mark>, were chosen for this study.
We transfected pcDNA3.1-<mark>UCH-L1</mark> plasmid and <mark>UCH-L1</mark> siRNA into MCF7 and MCF7/Adr cells, respectively.
Using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, western blot, Hoechst 33258 staining assay and flow cytometry, we found that over-expression of <mark>UCH-L1</mark> in MCF7 cells induced apoptosis.
On the other hand, silencing of <mark>UCH-L1</mark> in MCF7/Adr cells led to the opposite effect.
Moreover, to explore the mechanism underling these observations, we further investigated the expression of phospho-<mark>Akt</mark> and its downstream signal phospho-IkB-alpha and other signal molecules including <mark>Fas</mark>, <mark>Fas-L</mark>, <mark>Trail</mark>, <mark>DR4</mark>, <mark>DR5</mark>, <mark>Bax</mark>, <mark>cytochrome C</mark>, active <mark>caspase-3</mark>, phospho-<mark>p53</mark>, phospho-<mark>Mdm-2</mark>, <mark>Bcl-2</mark>, <mark>Bcl-xL</mark>, <mark>p21</mark> and <mark>p27</mark>.
The results indicated that the process of apoptosis triggered by <mark>UCH-L1</mark> is, at least in part, probably through <mark>Phosphoinositide 3-kinase</mark> (<mark>PI3K</mark>)/<mark>Akt</mark> signal pathway.
Our findings suggest that modulating the ubiquitination and deubiquitination pathway could be a novel method for tumor therapy.
A chemical compound commonly used to inhibit <mark>PKR</mark>, {8-(imidazol-4-ylmethylene)-6H-azolidino[5,4-g] benzothiazol-7-one}, protects neurons by inhibiting <mark>cyclin-dependent kinase</mark>.
Activation of the <mark>double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase</mark> (<mark>PKR</mark>) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases.
We find that a compound widely used as a pharmacological inhibitor of this enzyme, referred to as <mark>PKR</mark> inhibitor (PKRi), {8-(imidazol-4-ylmethylene)-6H-azolidino[5,4-g]benzothiazol-7-one}, protects against the death of cultured cerebellar granule and cortical neurons.
PKRi also prevents striatal neurodegeneration and improves behavioral outcomes in a chemically induced mouse model of Huntington's disease.
Surprisingly, PKRi fails to block the phosphorylation of <mark>eIF2alpha</mark>, a downstream target of <mark>PKR</mark>, and does not reduce the autophosphorylation of <mark>PKR</mark> enzyme immunoprecipitated from neurons.
Furthermore, neurons lacking <mark>PKR</mark> are fully protected from apoptosis by PKRi, demonstrating that neuroprotection by this compound is not mediated by <mark>PKR</mark> inhibition.
Using in vitro kinase assays we investigated whether PKRi affects any other <mark>protein kinase</mark>.
These analyses demonstrated that PKRi has no major inhibitory effect on pro-apoptotic <mark>kinases</mark> such as the <mark>c-Jun N-terminal kinases</mark>, the <mark>p38 MAP kinases</mark> and the death-associated <mark>protein kinases</mark>, or on other <mark>kinases</mark> including <mark>c-Raf</mark>, <mark>MEK1</mark>, <mark>MKK6</mark> and <mark>MKK7</mark>.
PKRi does, however, inhibit the activity of certain <mark>cyclin-dependent kinases</mark> (<mark>CDKs</mark>), including <mark>CDK1</mark>, <mark>CDK2</mark> and <mark>CDK5</mark> both in vitro and in low potassium-treated neurons.
Consistent with its inhibitory action on mitotic <mark>CDKs</mark>, the treatment of HT-22 and HEK293T cell lines with PKRi sharply reduces the rate of cell cycle progression.
Taken together with the established role of <mark>CDK</mark> activation in the promotion of neurodegeneration, our results suggest that PKRi exerts its neuroprotective action by inhibiting <mark>CDK</mark>.
Lymphoid tissue inducer-like cells are an innate source of <mark>IL-17</mark> and <mark>IL-22</mark>.
The <mark>interleukin (IL) 17</mark> family of <mark>cytokines</mark> has emerged to be critical for host defense as well as the pathogenesis of autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders, and serves to link adaptive and innate responses.
Recent studies have identified a new subset of T cells that selectively produce <mark>IL-17</mark> (Th17 cells; Bettelli, E., T. Korn, and V.K. Kuchroo. 2007.
Curr.
Opin.
Immunol.
19:652-657; Kolls, J.K., and A. Linden. 2004. Immunity.
21:467-476), but the regulation of <mark>IL-17</mark> production by innate immune cells is less well understood.
We report that in vitro stimulation with <mark>IL-23</mark> induced <mark>IL-17</mark> production by <mark>recombination activating gene (Rag) 2</mark>(-/-) splenocytes but not <mark>Rag2</mark>(-/-) common gamma chain(-/-) splenocytes.
We found that a major source of <mark>IL-17</mark> was <mark>CD4</mark>(+)<mark>CD3</mark>(-)<mark>NK1.1</mark>(-)<mark>CD11b</mark>(-)<mark>Gr1</mark>(-)<mark>CD11c</mark>(-)<mark>B220</mark>(-) cells, a phenotype that corresponds to lymphoid tissue inducer-like cells (LTi-like cells), which constitutively expressed the <mark>IL-23 receptor</mark>, <mark>aryl hydrocarbon receptor</mark>, and <mark>CCR6</mark>.
In vivo challenge with the yeast cell wall product zymosan rapidly induced <mark>IL-17</mark> production in these cells.
Genetic deletion of <mark>signal transducer and activator of transcription 3</mark> reduced but did not abrogate <mark>IL-17</mark> production in LTi-like cells.
Thus, it appears that splenic LTi-like cells are a rapid source of <mark>IL-17</mark> and <mark>IL-22</mark>, which might contribute to dynamic organization of secondary lymphoid organ structure or host defense.
<mark>Gammadelta</mark> T lymphocyte homeostasis is negatively regulated by <mark>beta2-microglobulin</mark>.
Successful application of gammadelta T cells in adoptive cell therapies depends upon our ability to maintain these cells in vivo.
Using an adoptive transfer model to study lymphopenia-induced homeostatic expansion, we show that <mark>CD8</mark>(+) and <mark>NK1.1</mark>(+) gammadelta T cell subsets are differentially regulated.
While <mark>CD8</mark>(+) gammadelta T cells have an early and sustained advantage following transfer into <mark>TCRbeta(-/-)/delta</mark>(-/-) mice, <mark>NK1.1</mark>(+) gammadelta T cells proliferate slowly and are maintained at low numbers.
The advantage of the <mark>CD8</mark>(+) subset could not be explained by increased <mark>bcl-2</mark> or cytokine receptor expression but did correlate with <mark>Vgamma4</mark>(+) and <mark>Vdelta5</mark>(+) expression.
Despite the role of <mark>CD8</mark> in MHC class I recognition by alphabeta T cells, <mark>beta(2)-microglobulin</mark> (<mark>beta(2)m</mark>)-associated MHC class I molecules were not required for <mark>CD8</mark>(+) <mark>gammadelta</mark> T cell homeostatic expansion.
Surprisingly, all <mark>gammadelta</mark> T cells, including the <mark>CD8</mark>(+) subset, exhibited enhanced proliferation following adoptive transfer into <mark>Rag1</mark>(-/-)/<mark>beta(2)m</mark>(-/-) compared with <mark>Rag1</mark>(-/-) recipients.
This effect was most notable for the <mark>NK1.1</mark>(+) subset, which expresses high levels of <mark>NKG2A</mark>/<mark>CD94</mark> and <mark>Ly49</mark>.
Although expression of these inhibitory receptors correlated with poor homeostatic expansion in the presence of <mark>beta(2)m</mark>, gammadelta T cell homeostatic proliferation in <mark>TCRbeta(-/-)/delta</mark>(-/-) mice was not altered in the presence of <mark>Ly49C/I</mark>- and <mark>NKG2</mark>-blocking Abs.
While the mechanism by which <mark>beta(2)m</mark> negatively regulates gammadelta T cell homeostasis remains to be determined, this observation is unique to gammadelta T cells and confirms that multiple mechanisms are in place to maintain strict regulation of both the size and the composition of the gammadelta T cell pool.
<mark>Neuregu<mark>Neuregulin-1</mark>mark> and <mark>neuregu<mark>neuregulin-1 alpha</mark> differentially affect the migration and invasion of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cells.
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the most common malignancy associated with neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1).
These Schwann cell lineage-derived sarcomas aggressively invade adjacent nerve and soft tissue, frequently precluding surgical resection.
Little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying this invasive behavior.
We have shown that MPNSTs express <mark>neuregu<mark>neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) <mark>NRG-1</mark>/mark> isoforms, which promote Schwann cell migration during development, and <mark>NRG-1</<mark>NRG-1 alpha</mark> isoforms, whose effects on Schwann cells are poorly understood.
Hypothesizing that <mark>NRG-1</<mark>NRG-1 beta</mark> and/or <mark>NRG-1</<mark>NRG-1 alpha</mark> promote MPNST invasion, we found that <mark>NRG-1</<mark>NRG-1 beta</mark> promoted MPNST migration in a substrate-specific manner, markedly enhancing migration on <mark>laminin</mark> but not on <mark>collagen type I</mark> or <mark>fibronectin</mark>.
The <mark>NRG-1 r<mark>NRG-1</mark>ors</mark> <mark>erbB3</mark> and <mark>erbB4</mark> were present in MPNST invadopodia (processes mediating invasion), partially colocalized with <mark>focal adhesion kinase</mark> and the <mark>laminin receptor</mark> <mark>beta(1)-integrin</mark> and coimmunoprecipitated with <mark>beta(1)-integrin</mark>.
<mark>NRG-1 b<mark>NRG-1</mark>mark> stimulated human and murine MPNST cell migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner in three-dimensional migration assays, acting as a chemotactic factor.
Both baseline and <mark>NRG-1 b<mark>NRG-1</mark>mark>-induced migration were <mark>erbB</mark>-dependent and required the action of <mark>MEK 1/2</mark>, <mark>SAPK</mark>/<mark>JNK</mark>, <mark>PI-3 kinase</mark>, <mark>Src family kinases</mark> and <mark>ROCK-I/II</mark>.
In contrast, <mark>NRG-1</<mark>NRG-1 alpha</mark> had no effect on the migration and invasion of some MPNST lines and inhibited the migration of others.
While <mark>NRG-1</<mark>NRG-1 beta</mark> potently and persistently activated <mark>Erk 1/2</mark>, <mark>SAPK</ma<mark>APK</mark>/<mark>JNK</mark>, <mark>Akt</mark> and <mark>Src family kinases</mark>, <mark>NRG-1 a<mark>NRG-1</mark>/mark> did not activate <mark>Akt</mark> and activated these other kinases with kinetics distinct from those evident in <mark>NRG-1</<mark>NRG-1 beta</mark>-stimulated cells.
These findings suggest that <mark>NRG-1</<mark>NRG-1 beta</mark> enhances MPNST migration and that <mark>NRG-1</<mark>NRG-1 beta</mark> and <mark>NRG-1 a<mark>NRG-1</mark>/mark> differentially modulate this process.
<mark>Sca-1</mark>+ stem cell survival and engraftment in the infarcted heart: dual role for preconditioning-induced <mark>connexin-43</mark>.
BACKGROUND: We report that elevated <mark>connexin-43</mark> (<mark>Cx-43</mark>) in stem cells preconditioned with <mark>insulin-like growth factor-1</mark> (<mark>IGF-1</mark>) is cytoprotective and reprograms the cells for cardiomyogenic differentiation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: <mark>Sca-1</mark>+ cells were preconditioned with 100 nmol/L <mark>IGF-1</mark> for 30 minutes followed by 8 hours of oxygen glucose deprivation to assess the cytoprotective effects of preconditioning.
LDH release assay, <mark>cytochrome c</mark> release, and mitochondrial membrane potential assay showed improved survival of preconditioned <mark>Sca-1</mark>+ cells under oxygen glucose deprivation compared with nonpreconditioned <mark>Sca-1</mark>+ cells via <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark>-dependent <mark>caspase-3</mark> downregulation.
We observed <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark>-dependent upregulation of cardiac-specific markers including <mark>MEF-2c</mark> (2.5-fold), <mark>GATA4</mark> (3.1-fold), and <mark>Cx-43</mark> (3.5-fold).
<mark>Cx-43</mark> inhibition with specific RNA interference reduced cell survival under oxygen glucose deprivation and after transplantation.
In vivo studies were performed in a female rat model of acute myocardial infarction (n=78).
Animals were grouped to receive intramyocardially 70 microL Dulbecco modified Eagles medium without cells (group 1) or containing male 1 x 10(6) nonpreconditioned <mark>Sca-1</mark>+ cells (group 2) or preconditioned <mark>Sca-1+ <mark>Sca-1</mark>p 3</mark>) cells labeled with PKH26.
Survival of the preconditioned <mark>Sca-1</mark>+ cells was 5.5-fold higher in <mark>group 3</mark> compared with group 2 at 7 days after transplantation.
Confocal imaging after actinin and <mark>Cx-43</mark> specific immunostaining showed extensive engraftment and myogenic differentiation of preconditioned <mark>Sca-1</mark>+ cells.
Compared with group 2, <mark>group 3</mark> showed increased blood vessel density (22.3+/-1.7 per microscopic field; P<0.0001) and attenuated infarction size (23.3+/-3.6%; P=0.002).
Heart function indices including ejection fraction (56.2+/-3.5; P=0.029) and fractional shortening (24.3+/-2.1; P=0.03) were improved in <mark>group 3</mark> compared with group 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Preconditioning with <mark>IGF-1</mark> reprograms <mark>Sca-1</mark>+ for prosurvival signaling and cardiomyogenic differentiation with an important role for <mark>Cx-43</mark> in this process.
<mark>Hematopoietic- and neurologic-expressed sequence 1</mark> (<mark>Hn1</mark>) depletion in B16.F10 melanoma cells promotes a differentiated phenotype that includes increased melanogenesis and cell cycle arrest.
The <mark>Hematopoietic- and neurologic-expressed sequence 1</mark> (<mark>Hn1</mark>) gene encodes a small protein that is highly conserved among species.
<mark>Hn1</mark> expression is upregulated in regenerating neural tissues, including the axotomized adult rodent facial motor nerve and dedifferentiating retinal pigment epithelial cells of the Japanese newt.
It is also expressed in numerous tissues during embryonic development as well as in regions of the adult brain that exhibit high plasticity.
<mark>Hn1</mark> has also been reported as a marker for human ovarian carcinoma and it is expressed in high-grade human gliomas.
This study was directed toward understanding the function of <mark>Hn1</mark> in a murine melanoma cell line.
<mark>Hn1</mark> mRNA and protein were identified in B16.F10 cells and in tumors formed from these cells.
Inhibition of <mark>Hn1</mark> protein expression with siRNA increased melanogenesis.
<mark>Hn1</mark>-depleted cells expressed higher levels of the <mark>melanogenic proteins</mark> <mark>tyrosinase</mark> and <mark>Trp2</mark> and an increased interaction between <mark>actin</mark> and <mark>Rab27a</mark>.
The in vitro cell growth rate of <mark>Hn1</mark>-depleted cells was significantly reduced due to G1/S cell cycle arrest.
This was consistent with a reduction in the phosphorylation of <mark>retinoblastoma protein</mark> as well as lower levels of <mark>p27</mark> and increased expression of <mark>p21</mark>.
Decreased expression of <mark>c-Met</mark>, the receptor for <mark>hepatocyte growth factor</mark>, was also detected in the <mark>Hn1</mark>-depleted cells, however <mark>HGF</mark>-dependent stimulation of phosphorylated-<mark>ERK</mark> was unaffected.
<mark>Hn1</mark> depletion also led to increased basal levels of phosphorylated <mark>p38 MAPK</mark>, while basal <mark>ERK</mark> phosphorylation was reduced.
Moreover, <mark>Hn1</mark>-depleted cells had reduced expression of transcription factors <mark>MITF</mark> and <mark>USF-1</mark>, and increased expression of <mark>TFE3</mark>.
These data, coupled with reports on <mark>Hn1</mark> expression in regeneration and development, suggest that <mark>Hn1</mark> functions as a suppressor of differentiation in cells undergoing repair or proliferation.
<mark>SIRT1</mark> <mark>histone deacetylase</mark> expression is associated with microsatellite instability and CpG island methylator phenotype in colorectal cancer.
The <mark>class III histone deacetylase</mark> <mark>SIRT1</mark> (<mark>sir2</mark>) is important in epigenetic gene silencing.
Inhibition of <mark>SIRT1</mark> reactivates silenced genes, suggesting a possible therapeutic approach of targeted reversal of aberrantly silenced genes.
In addition, <mark>SIRT1</mark> may be involved in the well-known link between obesity, cellular energy balance and cancer.
However, a comprehensive study of <mark>SIRT1</mark> using human cancer tissue with clinical outcome data is currently lacking, and its prognostic significance is uncertain.
Using the database of 485 colorectal cancers in two independent prospective cohort studies, we detected <mark>SIRT1</mark> overexpression in 180 (37%) tumors by immunohistochemistry.
We examined its relationship to the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), related molecular events, clinical features including body mass index, and patient survival.
We quantified DNA methylation in eight CIMP-specific promoters (<mark>CACNA1G</mark>, <mark>CDKN2A</mark>, <mark>CRABP1</mark>, <mark>IGF2</mark>, <mark>MLH1</mark>, <mark>NEUROG1</mark>, <mark>RUNX3</mark>, and <mark>SOCS1</mark>) and eight other CpG islands (<mark>CHFR</mark>, <mark>HIC1</mark>, <mark>IGFBP3</mark>, <mark>MGMT</mark>, <mark>MINT1</mark>, <mark>MINT31</mark>, <mark>p14</mark>, and <mark>WRN</mark>) by MethyLight.
<mark>SIRT1</mark> overexpression was associated with CIMP-high (&gt; or =6 of 8 methylated CIMP-specific promoters, P=0.002) and microsatellite instability (MSI)-high phenotype (P&lt;0.0001).
In both univariate and multivariate analyses, <mark>SIRT1</mark> overexpression was significantly associated with the CIMP-high MSI-high phenotype (multivariate odds ratio, 3.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-7.59; P=0.008).
In addition, mucinous component (P=0.01), high tumor grade (P=0.02), and <mark>fatty acid synthase</mark> overexpression (P=0.04) were significantly associated with <mark>SIRT</mark> positivity in multivariate analysis.
<mark>SIRT1</mark> was not significantly related with age, sex, tumor location, stage, signet ring cells, <mark>cyclooxygenase-2</mark> (<mark>COX-2</mark>), LINE-1 hypomethylation, <mark>KRAS</mark>, <mark>BRAF</mark>, <mark>BMI</mark>, <mark>PIK3CA</mark>, <mark>HDAC</mark>, <mark>p53</mark>, <mark>beta-catenin</mark>, <mark>COX-2</mark>, or patient prognosis.
In conclusion, <mark>SIRT1</mark> expression is associated with CIMP-high MSI-high colon cancer, suggesting involvement of <mark>SIRT1</mark> in gene silencing in this unique tumor subtype.
Derivation of a novel undifferentiated human foetal phenotype in serum-free cultures with <mark>BMP-2</mark>.
Skeletal stem and progenitor populations provide a platform for cell-based tissue regeneration strategies.
Optimized conditions for ex vivo expansion will be critical and use of serum-free culture may allow enhanced modelling of differentiation potential.
Maintenance of human foetal femur-derived cells in a chemically defined medium (CDM) with <mark>activin A</mark> and <mark>fibroblast growth factor-2</mark> generated a unique undifferentiated cell population in comparison to basal cultures, with significantly reduced amino acid depletion, appearance and turnover, reduced <mark>alkaline phosphatase</mark> (<mark>ALP</mark>) activity and loss of <mark>type I and II collagen</mark> expression demonstrated by fluorescence immunocytochemistry.
Microarray analysis demonstrated up-regulation of <mark>CLU</mark>, <mark>OSR2</mark>, <mark>POSTN</mark> and <mark>RABGAP1</mark> and down-regulation of differentiation-associated genes <mark>CRYAB</mark>, <mark>CSRP1</mark>, <mark>EPAS1</mark>, <mark>GREM1</mark>, <mark>MT1X</mark> and <mark>SRGN</mark> as validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Application of osteogenic conditions to CDM cultures demonstrated partial rescue of <mark>ALP</mark> activity.
In contrast, the addition of <mark>bone morphogenetic protein-2</mark> (<mark>BMP-2</mark>) resulted in reduced <mark>ALP</mark> levels, increased amino acid metabolism and, strikingly, a marked shift to a cobblestone-like cellular morphology, with expression of <mark>SOX-2</mark> and <mark>SOX-9</mark> but not STRO-1 as shown by immunocytochemistry, and significantly altered expression of metabolic genes (<mark>GFPT2</mark>, <mark>SC4MOL</mark> and <mark>SQLE</mark>), genes involved in morphogenesis (<mark>SOX15</mark> and <mark>WIF1</mark>) and differentiation potential (<mark>C1orf19</mark>, <mark>CHSY-2</mark>,<mark>DUSP6</mark>, <mark>HMGCS1</mark> and <mark>PPL</mark>).
These studies demonstrate the use of an intermediary foetal cellular model for differentiation studies in chemically defined conditions and indicate the in vitro reconstruction of the mesenchymal condensation phenotype in the presence of <mark>BMP-2</mark>, with implications therein for rescue studies, screening assays and skeletal regeneration research.
<mark>Melanocortin-4 receptor</mark> activation inhibits <mark>c-Jun N-terminal kinase</mark> activity and promotes <mark>insulin</mark> signaling.
The <mark>melanocortin</mark> system is crucial to regulation of energy homeostasis.
The <mark>melanocortin receptor type 4</mark> (<mark>MC4R</mark>) modulates <mark>insulin</mark> signaling via effects on <mark>c-Jun N-terminal kinase</mark> (<mark>JNK</mark>).
The <mark>melanocortin</mark> agonist NDP-MSH dose-dependently inhibited <mark>JNK</mark> activity in HEK293 cells stably expressing the human <mark>MC4R</mark>; effects were reversed by <mark>melanocortin receptor</mark> antagonist.
NDP-MSH time- and dose-dependently inhibited <mark>IRS-1</mark>(ser307) phosphorylation, effects also reversed by a specific <mark>melanocortin receptor</mark> antagonist.
NDP-MSH augmented <mark>insulin</mark>-stimulated <mark>AKT</mark> phosphorylation in vitro.
The <mark>melanocortin</mark> agonist melanotan II increased <mark>insulin</mark>-stimulated <mark>AKT</mark> phosphorylation in the rat hypothalamus in vivo.
NDP-MSH increased <mark>insulin</mark>-stimulated glucose uptake in hypothalamic GT1-1 cells.
The current study shows that the melanocortinergic system interacts with <mark>insulin</mark> signaling via novel effects on <mark>JNK</mark> activity.
<mark>Notch</mark> signaling is required for lateral induction of <mark>Jagged1</mark> during <mark>FGF</mark>-induced lens fiber differentiation.
Previous studies of the developing lens have shown that <mark>Notch</mark> signaling regulates differentiation of lens fiber cells by maintaining a proliferating precursor pool in the anterior epithelium.
However, whether <mark>Notch</mark> signaling is further required after the onset of fiber cell differentiation is not clear.
This work investigates the role of <mark>Notch2</mark> and <mark>Jagged1</mark> (<mark>Jag1</mark>) in secondary fiber cell differentiation using rat lens epithelial explants undergoing <mark>FGF-2</mark> dependent differentiation in vitro.
<mark>FGF</mark> induced <mark>Jag1</mark> expression and <mark>Notch2</mark> signaling (as judged by the appearance of activated <mark>Notch2 Intracellular Domain</mark> (N2ICD)) within 12-24 h. These changes were correlated with induction of the <mark>Notch</mark> effector, <mark>Hes5</mark>, upregulation of <mark>N-cadherin</mark> (<mark>N-cad</mark>), and downregulation of <mark>E-cadherin</mark> (<mark>E-cad</mark>), a <mark>cadherin</mark> switch characteristic of fiber cell differentiation.
Induction of <mark>Jag1</mark> was efficiently blocked by U0126, a specific inhibitor of <mark>MAPK</mark>/<mark>ERK</mark> signaling, indicating a requirement for signaling through this pathway downstream of the <mark>FGF receptor</mark>.
Other growth factors that activate <mark>MAPK</mark>/<mark>ERK</mark> signaling (<mark>EGF</mark>, <mark>PDGF</mark>, <mark>IGF</mark>) did not induce <mark>Jag1</mark>.
Inhibition of <mark>Notch</mark> signaling using <mark>gamma secretase</mark> inhibitors DAPT and L-685,458 or anti-<mark>Jag1</mark> antibody markedly decreased <mark>FGF</mark>-dependent expression of <mark>Jag1</mark> demonstrating <mark>Notch</mark>-dependent lateral induction.
In addition, inhibition of <mark>Notch</mark> signaling reduced expression of <mark>N-cad</mark>, and the <mark>cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor</mark>, <mark>p57Kip2</mark>, indicating a direct role for <mark>Notch</mark> signaling in secondary fiber cell differentiation.
These results demonstrate that <mark>Notch</mark>-mediated lateral induction of <mark>Jag1</mark> is an essential component of <mark>FGF</mark>-dependent lens fiber cell differentiation.
<mark>TAK1</mark> is an essential regulator of <mark>BMP</mark> signalling in cartilage.
<mark>TGFbeta activated kinase 1</mark> (<mark>TAK1</mark>), a member of the <mark>MAPKKK</mark> family, controls diverse functions ranging from innate and adaptive immune system activation to vascular development and apoptosis.
To analyse the in vivo function of <mark>TAK1</mark> in cartilage, we generated mice with a conditional deletion of <mark>Tak1</mark> driven by the <mark>collagen 2</mark> promoter.
<mark>Tak1</mark>(<mark>col2</mark>) mice displayed severe chondrodysplasia with runting, impaired formation of secondary centres of ossification, and joint abnormalities including elbow dislocation and tarsal fusion.
This phenotype resembled that of <mark>bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR)1</mark> and <mark>Gdf5</mark>-deficient mice.
<mark>BMPR</mark> signalling was markedly impaired in <mark>TAK1</mark>-deficient chondrocytes as evidenced by reduced expression of known <mark>BMP</mark> target genes as well as reduced phosphorylation of <mark>Smad1/5/8</mark> and <mark>p38</mark>/<mark>Jnk</mark>/<mark>Erk</mark> <mark>MAP kinases</mark>.
<mark>TAK1</mark> mediates <mark>Smad1</mark> phosphorylation at C-terminal serine residues.
These findings provide the first in vivo evidence in a mammalian system that <mark>TAK1</mark> is required for <mark>BMP</mark> signalling and functions as an upstream activating kinase for <mark>Smad1/5/8</mark> in addition to its known role in regulating <mark>MAP kinase</mark> pathways.
Our experiments reveal an essential role for <mark>TAK1</mark> in the morphogenesis, growth, and maintenance of cartilage.
A novel combination of factors, termed <mark>SPIE</mark>, which promotes dopaminergic neuron differentiation from human embryonic stem cells.
BACKGROUND: Stromal-Derived Inducing Activity (SDIA) is one of the most efficient methods of generating dopaminergic (DA) neurons from embryonic stem cells (ESC).
DA neuron induction can be achieved by co-culturing ESC with the mouse stromal cell lines PA6 or MS5.
The molecular nature of this effect, which has been termed "SDIA" is so far unknown.
Recently, we found that factors secreted by PA6 cells provided lineage-specific instructions to induce DA differentiation of human ESC (hESC).
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, we compared PA6 cells to various cell lines lacking the SDIA effect, and employed genome expression analysis to identify differentially-expressed signaling molecules.
Among the factors highly expressed by PA6 cells, and known to be associated with CNS development, were <mark>stromal cell-derived factor 1</mark> (<mark>SDF-1</mark>/<mark>CXCL12</mark>), <mark>pleiotrophin</mark> (<mark>PTN</mark>), <mark>insulin-like growth factor 2</mark> (<mark>IGF2</mark>), and <mark>ephrin B1</mark> (<mark>EFNB1</mark>).
When these four factors, the combination of which was termed <mark>SPIE</mark>, were applied to hESC, they induced differentiation to TH-positive neurons in vitro.
RT-PCR and western blot analysis confirmed the expression of midbrain specific markers, including <mark>engrailed 1</mark>, <mark>Nurr1</mark>, <mark>Pitx3</mark>, and <mark>dopamine transporter</mark> (<mark>DAT</mark>) in cultures influenced by these four molecules.
Electrophysiological recordings showed that treatment of hESC with <mark>SPIE</mark> induced differentiation of neurons that were capable of generating action potentials and forming functional synaptic connections.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The combination of <mark>SDF-1</mark>, <mark>PTN</mark>, <mark>IGF2</mark>, and <mark>EFNB1</mark> mimics the DA phenotype-inducing property of SDIA and was sufficient to promote differentiation of hESC to functional midbrain DA neurons.
These findings provide a method for differentiating hESC to form DA neurons, without a requirement for the use of animal-derived cell lines or products.
<mark>Protein kinase C alpha</mark>-dependent signaling mediates endometrial cancer cell growth and tumorigenesis.
Endometrial cancer is the most common invasive gynecologic malignancy, yet molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying its etiology and pathophysiology remain poorly characterized.
We sought to define a functional role for the <mark>protein kinase C</mark> (<mark>PKC</mark>) isoform, <mark>PKCalpha</mark>, in an established cell model of endometrial adenocarcinoma.
Ishikawa cells depleted of <mark>PKCalpha</mark> protein grew slower, formed fewer colonies in anchorage-independent growth assays and exhibited impaired xenograft tumor formation in nude mice.
Consistent with impaired growth, <mark>PKCalpha</mark> knockdown increased levels of the <mark>cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors</mark> <mark>p21(Cip1/WAF1)</mark> (<mark>p21</mark>) and <mark>p27(Kip1)</mark> (<mark>p27</mark>).
Despite the absence of functional <mark>phosphatase and tensin homolog</mark> (<mark>PTEN</mark>) protein in Ishikawa cells, <mark>PKCalpha</mark> knockdown reduced <mark>Akt</mark> phosphorylation at serine 473 and concomitantly inhibited phosphorylation of the <mark>Akt</mark> target, <mark>glycogen synthase kinase-3beta</mark> (<mark>GSK-3beta</mark>).
<mark>PKCalpha</mark> knockdown also resulted in decreased basal <mark>ERK</mark> phosphorylation and attenuated <mark>ERK</mark> activation following EGF stimulation.
<mark>p21</mark> and <mark>p27</mark> expression was not increased by treatment of Ishikawa cells with <mark>ERK</mark> and <mark>Akt</mark> inhibitors, suggesting that <mark>PKCalpha</mark> regulates <mark>CDK</mark> expression independently of <mark>Akt</mark> and <mark>ERK</mark>.
Immunohistochemical analysis of Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma revealed aberrant <mark>PKCalpha</mark> expression, with foci of elevated <mark>PKCalpha</mark> staining, not observed in normal endometrium.
These studies demonstrate a critical role for <mark>PKCalpha</mark> signaling in endometrial tumorigenesis by regulating expression of CDK inhibitors <mark>p21</mark> and <mark>p27</mark> and activation of <mark>Akt</mark> and <mark>ERK</mark>-dependent proliferative pathways.
Thus, targeting <mark>PKCalpha</mark> may provide novel therapeutic options in endometrial tumors.
A prospective cohort study shows unique epigenetic, genetic, and prognostic features of synchronous colorectal cancers.
BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Synchronous colorectal neoplasias (2 or more primary carcinomas identified in the same patient) are caused by common genetic and environmental factors and can be used to study the field effect.
Synchronous colon cancers have not been compared with control solitary cancers in a prospective study.
METHODS: We analyzed data collected from 47 patients with synchronous colorectal cancers and 2021 solitary colorectal cancers (controls) in 2 prospective cohort studies.
Tumors samples were analyzed for methylation in LINE-1 and 16 CpG islands (<mark>CACNA1G</mark>, <mark>CDKN2A</mark> [<mark>p16</mark>], <mark>CRABP1</mark>, <mark>IGF2</mark>, <mark>MLH1</mark>, <mark>NEUROG1</mark>, <mark>RUNX3</mark>, <mark>SOCS1</mark>, <mark>CHFR</mark>, <mark>HIC1</mark>, <mark>IGFBP3</mark>, <mark>MGMT</mark>, <mark>MINT1</mark>, <mark>MINT31</mark>, <mark>p14</mark> [<mark>ARF</mark>], and <mark>WRN</mark>); microsatellite instability (MSI); the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP); 18q loss of heterozygosity; <mark>KRAS</mark>, <mark>BRAF</mark>, and <mark>PIK3CA</mark> mutations; and expression of <mark>beta-catenin</mark>, <mark>p53</mark>, <mark>p21</mark>, <mark>p27</mark>, <mark>cyclin D1</mark>, <mark>fatty acid synthase</mark>, and <mark>cyclooxygenase-2</mark>.
RESULTS: Compared with patients with solitary colorectal cancer, synchronous colorectal cancer patients had reduced overall survival time (log-rank, P = .0048; hazard ratio [HR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-2.50; P = .0053; multivariate HR, 1.47; 95% CI: 1.00-2.17; P = .049).
Compared with solitary tumors, synchronous tumors more frequently contained <mark>BRAF</mark> mutations (P = .0041), CIMP-high (P = .013), and MSI-high (P = .037).
Methylation levels of LINE-1 (Spearman r = 0.82; P = .0072) and CpG island methylation (P &lt; .0001) correlated between synchronous cancer pairs from the same individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: Synchronous colorectal cancers had more frequent mutations in <mark>BRAF</mark>, were more frequently CIMP- and MSI-high, and had a worse prognosis than solitary colorectal cancers.
Similar epigenomic and epigenetic events were frequently observed within a synchronous cancer pair, suggesting the presence of a field defect.
Regulation of <mark>Lhb</mark> and <mark>Egr1</mark> gene expression by <mark>GNRH</mark> pulses in rat pituitaries is both <mark>c-Jun N-terminal kinase</mark> (<mark>JNK</mark>)- and <mark>extracellular signal-regulated kinase</mark> (<mark>ERK</mark>)-dependent.
Pulsatile <mark>GNRH</mark> regulates the gonadotropin subunit genes in a differential manner, with faster frequencies favoring <mark>Lhb</mark> gene expression and slower frequencies favoring <mark>Fshb</mark>.
<mark>Early growth response 1</mark> (<mark>EGR1</mark>) is critical for <mark>Lhb</mark> gene transcription.
We examined <mark>GNRH</mark> regulation of <mark>EGR1</mark> and its two corepressors, <mark>Ngfi-A-binding proteins 1 and 2</mark> (<mark>NAB1</mark> and <mark>NAB2</mark>), both in vivo and in cultured rat pituitary cells.
In rats, fast <mark>GNRH</mark> pulses (every 30 min) stably induced <mark>Egr1</mark> primary transcript (PT) and mRNA 2-fold (P &lt; 0.05) for 1-24 h. In contrast, slow <mark>GNRH</mark> pulses (every 240 min) increased <mark>Egr1</mark> PT at 24 h (6-fold; P &lt; 0.05) but increased <mark>Egr1</mark> mRNA 4- to 5-fold between 4 and 24 h. Both <mark>GNRH</mark> pulse frequencies increased <mark>EGR1</mark> protein 3- to 4-fold.
In cultured rat pituitary cells, <mark>GNRH</mark> pulses (every 60 min) increased <mark>Egr1</mark> (PT, 2.5- to 3-fold; mRNA, 1.5- to 2-fold; P &lt; 0.05).
<mark>GNRH</mark> pulses had little effect on <mark>Nab1/2</mark> PT/mRNAs either in vivo or in vitro.
We also examined specific intracellular signaling cascades activated by <mark>GNRH</mark>.
Inhibitors of <mark>mitogen-activated protein kinase 8/9</mark> (<mark>MAPK8/9</mark> [also known as <mark>JNK</mark>]; SP600125) and <mark>MAP Kinase Kinase 1</mark> (<mark>MAP2K1</mark> [also known as <mark>MEK1</mark>]; PD98059) either blunted or totally suppressed the <mark>GNRH</mark> induction of <mark>Lhb</mark> PT and <mark>Egr1</mark> PT/mRNA, whereas the <mark>MAPK14</mark> (also known as <mark>p38</mark>) inhibitor SB203580 did not.
In summary, pulsatile <mark>GNRH</mark> stimulates <mark>Egr1</mark> gene expression and protein in vivo but not in a frequency-dependent manner.
Additionally, <mark>GNRH</mark>-induced <mark>Egr1</mark> gene expression is mediated by <mark>MAPK8/9</mark> and <mark>MAPK1/3</mark>, and both are critical for <mark>Lhb</mark> gene transcription.
U2OS cells lacking <mark>Chk1</mark> undergo aberrant mitosis and fail to activate the spindle checkpoint.
<mark>Chk1</mark> is a conserved <mark>protein kinase</mark> originally identified in fission yeast, required to delay entry of cells with damaged or unreplicated DNA into mitosis.
The requirement of <mark>Chk1</mark> for both S and G2/M checkpoints has been elucidated while only few studies have connected <mark>Chk1</mark> to the mitotic spindle checkpoint.
We used a small interference RNA strategy to investigate the role of <mark>Chk1</mark> in unstressed conditions.
<mark>Chk1</mark> depletion in U2OS human osteosarcoma cells inhibited cell proliferation and raised the percentage of cells with a 4N DNA content, which correlated with accumulation of giant polynucleated cells morphologically distinct from apoptotic cells, while no increased number of cells in G2 or mitosis could be detected.
Down-regulation of <mark>Chk1</mark> also caused accumulation of cells in the last step of cytokinesis, and of tetraploid cells in G1 phase, which coincided with activation of <mark>p53</mark> and increased levels of <mark>p21</mark>.
In addition, <mark>Chk1</mark>-depleted U2OS cells failed to arrest in mitosis after spindle disruption by nocodazole and showed decreased protein levels of <mark>Mad2</mark> and <mark>BubR1</mark>.
These studies show that U2OS cells lacking <mark>Chk1</mark> undergo abnormal mitosis and fail to activate the spindle checkpoint, suggesting a role of <mark>Chk1</mark> in this checkpoint.
<mark>Vitamin D receptor</mark> expression is associated with <mark>PIK3CA</mark> and <mark>KRAS</mark> mutations in colorectal cancer.
Vitamin D is associated with decreased risks of various cancers, including colon cancer.
The <mark>vitamin D receptor</mark> (<mark>VDR</mark>) is a <mark>transcription factor</mark>, which plays an important role in cellular differentiation and inhibition of proliferation.
A link between <mark>VDR</mark> and the <mark>RAS</mark>-<mark>mitogen-activated protein kinase</mark> (<mark>MAPK</mark>) or <mark>phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase</mark> (<mark>PI3K</mark>)-<mark>AKT</mark> pathway has been suggested.
However, the prognostic role of <mark>VDR</mark> expression or its relationship with <mark>PIK3CA</mark> or <mark>KRAS</mark> mutation remains uncertain.
Among 619 colorectal cancers in two prospective cohort studies, 233 (38%) tumors showed <mark>VDR</mark> overexpression by immunohistochemistry.
We analyzed for <mark>PIK3CA</mark> and <mark>KRAS</mark> mutations and LINE-1 methylation by Pyrosequencing, microsatellite instability (MSI), and DNA methylation (epigenetic changes) in eight CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-specific promoters [<mark>CACNA1G</mark>, <mark>CDKN2A</mark> (<mark>p16</mark>), <mark>CRABP1</mark>, <mark>IGF2</mark>, <mark>MLH1</mark>, <mark>NEUROG1</mark>, <mark>RUNX3</mark>, and <mark>SOCS1</mark>] by MethyLight (real-time PCR).
<mark>VDR</mark> overexpression was significantly associated with <mark>KRAS</mark> mutation (odds ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.16) and <mark>PIK3CA</mark> mutation (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.36-3.47), both of which persisted in multivariate logistic regression analysis.
<mark>VDR</mark> was not independently associated with body mass index, family history of colorectal cancer, tumor location (colon versus rectum), stage, tumor grade, signet ring cells, CIMP, MSI, LINE-1 hypomethylation, <mark>BRAF</mark>, <mark>p53</mark>, <mark>p21</mark>, <mark>beta-catenin</mark>, or <mark>cyclooxygenase-2</mark>.
<mark>VDR</mark> expression was not significantly related with patient survival, prognosis, or clinical outcome.
In conclusion, <mark>VDR</mark> overexpression in colorectal cancer is independently associated with <mark>PIK3CA</mark> and <mark>KRAS</mark> mutations.
Our data support potential interactions between the <mark>VDR</mark>, <mark>RAS</mark>-<mark>MAPK</mark> and <mark>PI3K</mark>-<mark>AKT</mark> pathways, and possible influence by <mark>KRAS</mark> or <mark>PIK3CA</mark> mutation on therapy or chemoprevention targeting <mark>VDR</mark>.
Independent and cooperative roles of <mark>tumor necrosis factor-alpha</mark>, <mark>nuclear factor-kappaB</mark>, and <mark>bone morphogenetic protein-2</mark> in regulation of metastasis and osteomimicry of prostate cancer cells and differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells.
The molecular mechanisms involved in prostate cancer (PC) metastasis and bone remodeling are poorly understood.
We recently reported that <mark>phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B</mark> (<mark>Akt</mark>) mediates transcriptional regulation and activation of <mark>bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2</mark> signaling by <mark>nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB</mark> in bone metastatic prostate cancer cells.
In the present study, we demonstrate that <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>, whether activated by recombinant human <mark>tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha</mark> or by ectopic expression of the <mark>p65</mark> subunit, is involved in extracellular matrix adhesion and invasion of osteotropic PC-3 and C4-2B, but not LNCaP, cells.
The enhanced metastatic potential was associated with transcriptional upregulation of <mark>osteopontin</mark>, <mark>osteocalcin</mark>, and <mark>collagen IA1</mark> in osteotropic PC cells, suggesting their role in osteomimicry of PC cells.
Unlike <mark>BMP-4</mark>, <mark>BMP-2</mark> protein enhanced the invasive properties of C4-2B cells, but not in LNCaP cells.
Also, this effect was nullified by <mark>Noggin</mark>.
In addition, <mark>BMP-2</mark> mediates <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>-induced invasion of C4-2B cells in a <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>-dependent fashion.
<mark>TNF-alpha</mark> or conditioned media (CM) of <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>-stimulated C4-2B cells upregulated <mark>BMP-2</mark> and <mark>BMP</mark>-dependent <mark>Smad</mark> transcripts and inhibited <mark>receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand</mark> transcripts in RAW 264.7 preosteoclast cells, respectively, implying that this factor may contribute to suppression of osteoclastogenesis via direct and paracrine mechanisms.
In contrast, CM of <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>-stimulate or <mark>BMP2</mark>-stimulated C4-2B cells induced in vitro mineralization of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cells in a <mark>BMP-2</mark>-dependent and <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>-dependent manner, respectively.
Taken together, the results suggest that mutual interactions between these factors may be pivotal not only in enhancing the osteomimicry and metastatic potential of PC cells, but also in bone remodeling and in shifting the balance from osteoclastogenesis towards osteoblastogenesis.
<mark>H3 histamine receptor</mark>-mediated activation of <mark>protein kinase Calpha</mark> inhibits the growth of cholangiocarcinoma in vitro and in vivo.
Histamine regulates functions via four receptors (<mark>HRH1</mark>, <mark>HRH2</mark>, <mark>HRH3</mark>, and <mark>HRH4</mark>).
The d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3))/Ca(2+)/<mark>protein kinase C</mark> (<mark>PKC</mark>)/<mark>mitogen-activated protein kinase</mark> pathway regulates cholangiocarcinoma growth.
We evaluated the role of <mark>HRH3</mark> in the regulation of cholangiocarcinoma growth.
Expression of <mark>HRH3</mark> in intrahepatic and extrahepatic cell lines, normal cholangiocytes, and human tissue arrays was measured.
In Mz-ChA-1 cells stimulated with (R)-(alpha)-(-)-methylhistamine dihydrobromide (RAMH), we measured (a) cell growth, (b) IP(3) and cyclic AMP levels, and (c) phosphorylation of <mark>PKC</mark> and <mark>mitogen-activated protein kinase</mark> isoforms.
Localization of <mark>PKCalpha</mark> was visualized by immunofluorescence in cell smears and immunoblotting for <mark>PKCalpha</mark> in cytosol and membrane fractions.
Following knockdown of <mark>PKCalpha</mark>, Mz-ChA-1 cells were stimulated with RAMH before evaluating cell growth and <mark>extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2</mark> phosphorylation.
In vivo experiments were done in BALB/c nude mice.
Mice were treated with saline or RAMH for 44 days and tumor volume was measured.
Tumors were excised and evaluated for proliferation, apoptosis, and expression of <mark>PKCalpha</mark>, <mark>vascula<mark>vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A<mark>VEGF)-A</mark>, <mark>VEGF-C</mark>, <mark>VEGF receptor 2</mark>, and <mark>VEGF receptor 3</mark>.
<mark>HRH3</mark> expression was found in all cells.
RAMH inhibited the growth of cholangiocarcinoma cells.
RAMH increased IP(3) levels and <mark>PKCalpha</mark> phosphorylation and decreased <mark>ERK1/2</mark> phosphorylation.
RAMH induced a shift in the localization of <mark>PKCalpha</mark> expression from the cytosolic domain into the membrane region of Mz-ChA-1 cells.
Silencing of <mark>PKCalpha</mark> prevented RAMH inhibition of Mz-ChA-1 cell growth and ablated RAMH effects on <mark>ERK1/2</mark> phosphorylation.
In vivo, RAMH decreased tumor growth and expression of <mark>VEGF</mark> and its receptors; <mark>PKCalpha</mark> expression was increased.
RAMH inhibits cholangiocarcinoma growth by <mark>PKCalpha</mark>-dependent <mark>ERK1/2</mark> dephosphorylation.
Modulation of <mark>PKCalpha</mark> by <mark>histamine receptors</mark> may be important in regulating cholangiocarcinoma growth.
The <mark>Mre11</mark>/<mark>Rad50</mark>/<mark>Nbs1</mark> complex functions in resection-based DNA end joining in Xenopus laevis.
The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is essential to maintain genomic integrity.
In higher eukaryotes, DNA DSBs are predominantly repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), but DNA ends can also be joined by an alternative error-prone mechanism termed microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ).
In MMEJ, the repair of DNA breaks is mediated by annealing at regions of microhomology and is always associated with deletions at the break site.
In budding yeast, the <mark>Mre11/Rad5/Xrs2 complex</mark> has been demonstrated to play a role in both classical NHEJ and MMEJ, but the involvement of the analogous <mark>MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) complex</mark> in end joining in higher eukaryotes is less certain.
Here we demonstrate that in Xenopus laevis egg extracts, the <mark>MRN complex</mark> is not required for classical <mark>DNA-PK</mark>-dependent NHEJ.
However, the <mark>XMRN complex</mark> is necessary for resection-based end joining of mismatched DNA ends.
This <mark>XMRN</mark>-dependent end joining process is independent of the core NHEJ components <mark>Ku70</mark> and <mark>DNA-PK</mark>, occurs with delayed kinetics relative to classical NHEJ and brings about repair at sites of microhomology.
These data indicate a role for the X. laevis MRN complex in MMEJ.
<mark>Sox2</mark> is required for maintenance and differentiation of bronchiolar Clara, ciliated, and goblet cells.
The bronchioles of the murine lung are lined by a simple columnar epithelium composed of ciliated, Clara, and goblet cells that together mediate barrier function, mucociliary clearance and innate host defense, vital for pulmonary homeostasis.
In the present work, we demonstrate that expression of <mark>Sox2</mark> in Clara cells is required for the differentiation of ciliated, Clara, and goblet cells that line the bronchioles of the postnatal lung.
The gene was selectively deleted in Clara cells utilizing <mark>Scgb1a1</mark>-Cre, causing the progressive loss of <mark>Sox2</mark> in the bronchioles during perinatal and postnatal development.
The rate of bronchiolar cell proliferation was decreased and associated with the formation of an undifferentiated, cuboidal-squamous epithelium lacking the expression of markers of Clara cells (<mark>Scgb1a1</mark>), ciliated cells (<mark>FoxJ1</mark> and <mark>alpha-tubulin</mark>), and goblet cells (<mark>Spdef</mark> and <mark>Muc5AC</mark>).
By adulthood, bronchiolar cell numbers were decreased and <mark>Sox2</mark> was absent in extensive regions of the bronchiolar epithelium, at which time residual <mark>Sox2</mark> expression was primarily restricted to selective niches of <mark>CGRP</mark> staining neuroepithelial cells.
Allergen-induced goblet cell differentiation and mucus production was absent in the respiratory epithelium lacking <mark>Sox2</mark>.
In vitro, <mark>Sox2</mark> activated promoter-luciferase reporter constructs for differentiation markers characteristic of Clara, ciliated, and goblet cells, <mark>Scgb1a1</mark>, <mark>FoxJ1</mark>, and <mark>Agr2</mark>, respectively.
<mark>Sox2</mark> physically interacted with <mark>Smad3</mark> and inhibited <mark>TGF-beta1</mark>/<mark>Smad3</mark>-mediated transcriptional activity in vitro, a pathway that negatively regulates proliferation.
<mark>Sox2</mark> is required for proliferation and differentiation of Clara cells that serve as the progenitor cells from which Clara, ciliated, and goblet cells are derived.
A Drosophila <mark>insulin-like peptide</mark> promotes growth during nonfeeding states.
In metazoans, tissue growth relies on the availability of nutrients--stored internally or obtained from the environment--and the resulting activation of <mark>insulin</mark>/<mark>IGF</mark> signaling (IIS).
In Drosophila, growth is mediated by seven Drosophila <mark>insulin-like peptides</mark> (<mark>Dilps</mark>), acting through a canonical IIS pathway.
During the larval period, animals feed and <mark>Dilps</mark> produced by the brain couple nutrient uptake with systemic growth.
We show here that, during metamorphosis, when feeding stops, a specific <mark>DILP</mark> (<mark>Dilp6</mark>) is produced by the fat body and relays the growth signal.
Expression of <mark>DILP6</mark> during pupal development is controlled by the steroid hormone ecdysone.
Remarkably, <mark>DILP6</mark> expression is also induced upon starvation, and both its developmental and environmental expression require the Drosophila <mark>FoxO</mark> transcription factor.
This study reveals a specific class of <mark>ILPs</mark> induced upon metabolic stress that promotes growth in conditions of nutritional deprivation or following developmentally induced cessation of feeding.
A genetic screen for modifiers of Drosophila <mark>caspase</mark> <mark>Dcp-1</mark> reveals <mark>caspase</mark> involvement in autophagy and novel <mark>caspase</mark>-related genes.
BACKGROUND: <mark>Caspases</mark> are <mark>cysteine proteases</mark> with essential functions in the apoptotic pathway; their proteolytic activity toward various substrates is associated with the morphological changes of cells.
Recent reports have described non-apoptotic functions of <mark>caspases</mark>, including autophagy.
In this report, we searched for novel modifiers of the phenotype of <mark>Dcp-1</mark> gain-of-function (GF) animals by screening promoter element- inserted Drosophila melanogaster lines (EP lines).
RESULTS: We screened approximately 15,000 EP lines and identified 72 <mark>Dcp-1</mark>-interacting genes that were classified into 10 groups based on their functions and pathways: 4 apoptosis signaling genes, 10 autophagy genes, 5 <mark>insulin</mark>/<mark>IGF</mark> and <mark>TOR</mark> signaling pathway genes, 6 <mark>MAP kinase</mark> and <mark>JNK</mark> signaling pathway genes, 4 ecdysone signaling genes, 6 ubiquitination genes, 11 various developmental signaling genes, 12 <mark>transcription factors</mark>, 3 <mark>translation factors</mark>, and 11 other unclassified genes including 5 functionally undefined genes.
Among them, <mark>insulin</mark>/<mark>IGF</mark> and <mark>TOR</mark> signaling pathway, <mark>MAP kinase</mark> and <mark>JNK</mark> signaling pathway, and ecdysone signaling are known to be involved in autophagy.
Together with the identification of autophagy genes, the results of our screen suggest that autophagy counteracts <mark>Dcp-1</mark>-induced apoptosis.
Consistent with this idea, we show that expression of <mark>eGFP</mark>-<mark>Atg5</mark> rescued the eye phenotype caused by <mark>Dcp-1</mark> GF.
Paradoxically, we found that over-expression of full-length <mark>Dcp-1</mark> induced autophagy, as <mark>Atg8b</mark>-<mark>GFP</mark>, an indicator of autophagy, was increased in the eye imaginal discs and in the S2 cell line.
Taken together, these data suggest that autophagy suppresses <mark>Dcp-1</mark>-mediated apoptotic cell death, whereas <mark>Dcp-1</mark> positively regulates autophagy, possibly through feedback regulation.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a number of <mark>Dcp-1</mark> modifiers that genetically interact with <mark>Dcp-1</mark>-induced cell death.
Our results showing that <mark>Dcp-1</mark> and autophagy-related genes influence each other will aid future investigations of the complicated relationships between apoptosis and autophagy.
Association of adipocyte genes with <mark>ASP</mark> expression: a microarray analysis of subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue in morbidly obese subjects.
BACKGROUND: Prevalence of obesity is increasing to pandemic proportions.
However, obese subjects differ in <mark>insulin</mark> resistance, <mark>adipokine</mark> production and co-morbidities.
Based on fasting plasma analysis, obese subjects were grouped as Low <mark>Acylation Stimulating protein</mark> (<mark>ASP</mark>) and Triglyceride (TG) (LAT) vs High <mark>ASP</mark> and TG (HAT).
Subcutaneous (SC) and omental (OM) adipose tissues (n = 21) were analysed by microarray, and biologic pathways in lipid metabolism and inflammation were specifically examined.
METHODS: LAT and HAT groups were matched in age, obesity, <mark>insulin</mark>, and glucose, and had similar expression of <mark>insulin</mark>-related genes (<mark>InsR</mark>, <mark>IRS-1</mark>).
<mark>ASP</mark> related genes tended to be increased in the HAT group and were correlated (<mark>factor B</mark>, <mark>adipsin</mark>, <mark>complement C3</mark>, p < 0.01 each).
Differences between LAT and HAT group were almost exclusively in SC tissue, with little difference in OM tissue.
Increased <mark>C5L2</mark> (p < 0.01), an <mark>ASP receptor</mark>, in HAT suggests a compensatory <mark>ASP</mark> pathway, associated with increased TG storage.
RESULTS: HAT adipose tissue demonstrated increased lipid related genes for storage (<mark>CD36</mark>, <mark>DGAT1</mark>, <mark>DGAT2</mark>, <mark>SCD1</mark>, <mark>FASN</mark>, and <mark>LPL</mark>), lipolysis (<mark>HSL</mark>, <mark>CES1</mark>, <mark>perilipin</mark>), <mark>fatty acid binding proteins</mark> (<mark>FABP1</mark>, <mark>FABP3</mark>) and adipocyte differentiation markers (<mark>CEBPalpha</mark>, <mark>CEBPbeta</mark>, <mark>PPARgamma</mark>).
By contrast, oxidation related genes were decreased (<mark>AMPK</mark>, <mark>UCP1</mark>, <mark>CPT1</mark>, <mark>FABP7</mark>).
HAT subjects had increased anti-inflammatory genes <mark>TGFB1</mark>, <mark>TIMP1</mark>, <mark>TIMP3</mark>, and <mark>TIMP4</mark> while proinflammatory <mark>PIG7</mark> and <mark>MMP2</mark> were also significantly increased; all genes, p < 0.025.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, the profile of <mark>C5L2</mark> receptor, <mark>ASP</mark> gene expression and metabolic factors in adipose tissue from morbidly obese HAT subjects suggests a compensatory response associated with the increased plasma <mark>ASP</mark> and TG.
Activated <mark>Ras</mark> alters lens and corneal development through induction of distinct downstream targets.
BACKGROUND: Mammalian <mark>Ras</mark> genes regulate diverse cellular processes including proliferation and differentiation and are frequently mutated in human cancers.
Tumor development in response to <mark>Ras</mark> activation varies between different tissues and the molecular basis for these variations are poorly understood.
The murine lens and cornea have a common embryonic origin and arise from adjacent regions of the surface ectoderm.
Activation of the <mark>fibroblast growth factor</mark> (<mark>FGF</mark>) signaling pathway induces the corneal epithelial cells to proliferate and the lens epithelial cells to exit the cell cycle.
The molecular mechanisms that regulate the differential responses of these two related tissues have not been defined.
We have generated transgenic mice that express a constitutively active version of human <mark>H-Ras</mark> in their lenses and corneas.
RESULTS: <mark>Ras</mark> transgenic lenses and corneal epithelial cells showed increased proliferation with concomitant increases in <mark>cyclin D1 and D2</mark> expression.
This initial increase in proliferation is sustained in the cornea but not in the lens epithelial cells.
Coincidentally, <mark>cdk inhibitors</mark> <mark>p27Kip1</mark> and <mark>p57Kip2</mark> were upregulated in the <mark>Ras</mark> transgenic lenses but not in the corneas.
Phospho-<mark>Erk1</mark> and <mark>Erk2</mark> levels were elevated in the lens but not in the cornea and <mark>Spry 1</mark> and <mark>Spry 2</mark>, negative regulators of <mark>Ras</mark>-<mark>Raf</mark>-<mark>Erk</mark> signaling, were upregulated more in the corneal than in the lens epithelial cells.
Both lens and corneal differentiation programs were sensitive to <mark>Ras</mark> activation.
<mark>Ras</mark> transgenic embryos showed a distinctive alteration in the architecture of the lens pit.
<mark>Ras</mark> activation, though sufficient for upregulation of <mark>Prox1</mark>, a <mark>transcription factor</mark> critical for cell cycle exit and initiation of fiber differentiation, is not sufficient for induction of terminal fiber differentiation.
Expression of <mark>Keratin 12</mark>, a marker of corneal epithelial differentiation, was reduced in the <mark>Ras</mark> transgenic corneas.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results suggest that <mark>Ras</mark> activation a) induces distinct sets of downstream targets in the lens and cornea resulting in distinct cellular responses and b) is sufficient for initiation but not completion of lens fiber differentiation.
Negative feedback regulation of <mark>Wnt4</mark> signaling by <mark>EAF1</mark> and <mark>EAF2</mark>/<mark>U19</mark>.
Previous studies indicated that <mark>EAF</mark> (<mark>ELL-associated factor</mark>) family members, <mark>EAF1</mark> and <mark>EAF2</mark>/<mark>U19</mark>, play a role in cancer and embryogenesis.
For example, <mark>EAF2</mark>/<mark>U19</mark> may serve as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer.
At the same time, <mark>EAF2</mark>/<mark>U19</mark> is a downstream factor in the non-canonical <mark>Wnt 4</mark> signaling pathway required for eye development in Xenopus laevis, and along with <mark>EAF1</mark>, contributes to convergence and extension movements in zebrafish embryos through <mark>Wnt</mark> maintenance.
Here, we used zebrafish embryos and mammalian cells to show that both <mark>EAF1</mark> and <mark>EAF2</mark>/<mark>U19</mark> were up-regulated by <mark>Wnt4</mark> (<mark>Wnt4a</mark>).
Furthermore, we found that <mark>EAF1</mark> and <mark>EAF2</mark>/<mark>U19</mark> suppressed <mark>Wnt4</mark> expression by directly binding to the <mark>Wnt4</mark> promoter as seen in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.
These findings indicate that an auto-regulatory negative feedback loop occurs between <mark>Wnt4</mark> and the <mark>EAF</mark> family, which is conserved between zebrafish and mammalian.
The rescue experiments in zebrafish embryos showed that early embryonic development required the maintenance of the appropriate levels of <mark>Wnt4a</mark> through the feedback loop.
Others have demonstrated that the tumor suppressors <mark>p63</mark>, <mark>p73</mark> and <mark>WT1</mark> positively regulate <mark>Wnt4</mark> expression while <mark>p21</mark> has the opposite effect, suggesting that maintenance of appropriate <mark>Wnt4</mark> expression may also be critical for adult tissue homeostasis and prevention against tumor initiation.
Thus, the auto-regulatory negative feedback loop that controls expression of <mark>Wnt4</mark> and <mark>EAF</mark> proteins may play an important role in both embryonic development and tumor suppression.
Our findings provide the first convincing line of evidence that <mark>EAF</mark> and <mark>Wnt4</mark> form an auto-regulatory negative feedback loop in vivo.
Activation of <mark>GPR30</mark> inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells through sustained activation of <mark>Erk1/2</mark>, <mark>c-jun</mark>/<mark>c-fos</mark>-dependent upregulation of <mark>p21</mark>, and induction of G(2) cell-cycle arrest.
<mark>G-protein-coupled receptor-30</mark> (<mark>GPR30</mark>) shows estrogen-binding affinity and mediates non-genomic signaling of estrogen to regulate cell growth.
We here showed for the first time, in contrast to the reported promoting action of <mark>GPR30</mark> on the growth of breast and ovarian cancer cells, that activation of <mark>GPR30</mark> by the receptor-specific, non-estrogenic ligand G-1 inhibited the growth of androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer (PCa) cells in vitro and PC-3 xenografts in vivo.
However, G-1 elicited no growth or histological changes in the prostates of intact mice and did not inhibit growth in quiescent BPH-1, an immortalized benign prostatic epithelial cell line.
Treatment of PC-3 cells with G-1 induced cell-cycle arrest at the G(2) phase and reduced the expression of G(2)-checkpoint regulators (<mark>cyclin-A2</mark>, <mark>cyclin-B1</mark>, <mark>cdc25c</mark>, and <mark>cdc2</mark>) and phosphorylation of their common transcriptional regulator <mark>NF-YA</mark> in PC-3 cells.
With extensive use of siRNA-knockdown experiments and the <mark>MEK</mark> inhibitor PD98059 in this study, we dissected the mechanism underlying G-1-induced inhibition of PC-3 cell growth, which was mediated through <mark>GPR30</mark>, followed by sustained activation of <mark>Erk1/2</mark> and a <mark>c-jun</mark>/<mark>c-fos</mark>-dependent upregulation of <mark>p21</mark>, resulting in the arrest of PC-3 growth at the G(2) phase.
The discovery of this signaling pathway lays the foundation for future development of <mark>GPR30</mark>-based therapies for PCa.
<mark>HOXB13</mark>, a target of <mark>DNMT3B</mark>, is methylated at an upstream CpG island, and functions as a tumor suppressor in primary colorectal tumors.
BACKGROUND: A hallmark of cancer cells is hypermethylation of CpG islands (CGIs), which probably arises from upregulation of one or more <mark>DNA methyltransferases</mark>.
The purpose of this study was to identify the targets of <mark>DNMT3B</mark>, an essential <mark>DNA methyltransferase</mark> in mammals, in colon cancer.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Chromatin immunoprecipitation with <mark>DNMT3B</mark> specific antibody followed by CGI microarray identified genes with or without CGIs, repeat elements and genomic contigs in RKO cells.
ChIP-Chop analysis showed that the majority of the target genes including <mark>P16</mark>, <mark>DCC</mark>, <mark>DISC1</mark>, <mark>SLIT1</mark>, <mark>CAVEOLIN1</mark>, <mark>GNA11</mark>, <mark>TBX5</mark>, <mark>TBX18</mark>, <mark>HOXB13</mark> and some histone variants, that harbor CGI in their promoters, were methylated in multiple colon cancer cell lines but not in normal colon epithelial cells.
Further, these genes were reactivated in RKO cells after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA hypomethylating agent.
COBRA showed that the CGIs encompassing the promoter and/or coding region of <mark>DCC</mark>, <mark>TBX5</mark>, <mark>TBX18</mark>, <mark>SLIT1</mark> were methylated in primary colorectal tumors but not in matching normal colon tissues whereas <mark>GNA11</mark> was methylated in both.
MassARRAY analysis demonstrated that the CGI located approximately 4.5 kb upstream of <mark>HOXB13</mark> +1 site was tumor-specifically hypermethylated in primary colorectal cancers and cancer cell lines.
<mark>HOXB13</mark> upstream CGI was partially hypomethylated in <mark>DNMT1</mark>(-/-) HCT cells but was almost methylation free in cells lacking both <mark>DNMT1</mark> and <mark>DNMT3B</mark>.
Analysis of tumor suppressor properties of two aberrantly methylated transcription factors, <mark>HOXB13</mark> and <mark>TBX18</mark>, revealed that both inhibited growth and clonogenic survival of colon cancer cells in vitro, but only <mark>HOXB13</mark> abolished tumor growth in nude mice.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first report that identifies several important tumor suppressors and transcription factors as direct <mark>DNMT3B</mark> targets in colon cancer and as potential biomarkers for this cancer.
Further, this study shows that methylation at an upstream CGI of <mark>HOXB13</mark> is unique to colon cancer.
Differential <mark>cytokine</mark> regulation by <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> and <mark>AP-1</mark> in Jurkat T-cells.
BACKGROUND: <mark>Activator protein (AP)-1</mark> and <mark>nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB</mark> largely control T-cell activation, following binding of foreign antigens to the <mark>T-cell receptor</mark> leading to <mark>cytokine</mark> secretion.
Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory <mark>cytokines</mark> and <mark>chemokines</mark> such as <mark>TNF</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark> and <mark>CXCL8</mark> are associated with several human diseases including cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis and AIDS.
The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the <mark>transcription factors</mark>, <mark>AP-1</mark> and <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>, in <mark>IL-6</mark> and <mark>CXCL8</mark> regulation in Jurkat T-cells.
RESULTS: Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) exposure resulted in an up-regulation of <mark>AP-1</mark> and down-regulation of <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> activity, however, exposure to heat killed (HK) Escherichia.
coli MG1655 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> activity without affecting <mark>AP-1</mark>.
The <mark>cytokine</mark> profile revealed an up-regulation of the <mark>chemokine</mark> <mark>CXCL8</mark> and the pro-inflammatory <mark>cytokines</mark> <mark>TNF</mark>, <mark>IL-2</mark> and <mark>IL-6</mark> following treatment with both PMA and HK E. coli, while the levels of the anti-inflammatory <mark>cytokine</mark> <mark>IL-10</mark> were not affected by PMA but were significantly down-regulated by HK E. coli.
<mark>AP-1</mark> activation was significantly increased 2 h after PMA exposure and continued to increase thereafter.
In contrast, <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> responded to PMA exposure by a rapid up-regulation followed by a subsequent down-regulation.
Increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations countered the down-regulation of <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> by PMA, while similar treatment with calcium ionophore resulted in a reduced <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> activity following induction with HK E. coli.
In order to further study <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> activation, we considered two up-stream signalling proteins, <mark>PKC</mark> and <mark>Bcl10</mark>.
Phosphorylated-<mark>PKC</mark> levels increased in response to PMA and HK E. coli, while <mark>Bcl10</mark> levels significantly decreased following PMA treatment.
Using an <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> activation inhibitor, we observed complete inhibition of <mark>IL-6</mark> expression while <mark>CXCL8</mark> levels only decreased by 40% at the highest concentration.
Treatment of Jurkat T-cells with PMA in the presence of <mark>JNK</mark>-inhibitor suppressed both <mark>CXCL8</mark> and <mark>IL-6</mark> while <mark>PKC</mark>-inhibitor primarily decreased <mark>CXCL8</mark> expression.
CONCLUSION: The present study shows that <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> regulated <mark>IL-6</mark> but not <mark>CXCL8</mark>.
This complex regulation of <mark>CXCL8</mark> suggests that there is a need to further evaluate the signalling pathways in order to develop new treatment for diseases with elevated <mark>CXCL8</mark> levels, such as AIDS and autoimmune diseases.
Forced homo- and heterodimerization of all <mark>gp130</mark>-type receptor complexes leads to constitutive ligand-independent signaling and <mark>cytokine</mark>-independent growth.
Naturally ligand independent constitutively active <mark>gp130</mark> variants were described to be responsible for inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas.
Recently, we genetically engineered a ligand-independent constitutively active <mark>gp130</mark> variant based on homodimerization of <mark>Jun</mark> leucine zippers.
Because also heterodimeric complexes within the <mark>gp130</mark> family may have tumorigenic potential, we seek to generate ligand-independent constitutively active heterodimers for all known <mark>gp130</mark>-receptor complexes based on <mark>IL-15</mark>/<mark>IL-15R alpha</mark>-sushi fusion proteins.
Ligand-independent heterodimerization of <mark>gp130</mark> with <mark>WSX-1</mark>, <mark>LIFR</mark>, and <mark>OSMR</mark> and of <mark>OSMR</mark> with <mark>GPL</mark> led to constitutive, ligand-independent <mark>STAT1</mark> and/or <mark>STAT3</mark> and <mark>ERK1/2</mark> phosphorylation.
Moreover, these receptor combinations induced transcription of the <mark>STAT3</mark> target genes <mark>c-myc</mark> and <mark>Pim-1</mark> and factor-independent growth of stably transduced Ba/F3-<mark>gp130</mark> cells.
Here, we establish the <mark>IL-15</mark>/<mark>IL-15R alpha</mark>-sushi system as a new system to mimic constitutive and ligand-independent activation of homo- and heterodimeric receptor complexes, which might be applicable to other heterodimeric receptor families.
A mutated <mark>IL-15</mark> protein, which was still able to bind the <mark>IL-15R alpha</mark>-sushi domain, but not to beta- and gamma-receptor chains, in combination with the 2A peptide technology may be used to translate our in vitro data into the in vivo situation to assess the tumorigenic potential of <mark>gp130</mark>-heterodimeric receptor complexes.
<mark>Subtilase cytotoxin</mark> induces apoptosis in HeLa cells by mitochondrial permeabilization via activation of <mark>Bax</mark>/<mark>Bak</mark>, independent of <mark>C/EBF-homologue protein</mark> (<mark>CHOP</mark>), <mark>Ire1alpha</mark> or <mark>JNK</mark> signaling.
<mark>Subtilase cytotoxin</mark> (<mark>SubAB</mark>) is an <mark>AB(5) cytotoxin</mark> produced by some strains of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli.
The <mark>A subunit</mark> is a <mark>subtilase-like serine protease</mark> and cleaves an <mark>endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone</mark>, <mark>BiP</mark>, leading to transient inhibition of protein synthesis and cell cycle arrest at G(1) phase, and inducing <mark>caspase</mark>-dependent apoptosis via mitochondrial membrane damage in Vero cells.
Here we investigated the mechanism of mitochondrial permeabilization in HeLa cells.
<mark>SubAB</mark>-induced <mark>cytochrome c</mark> release into cytosol did not depend on mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), since cyclosporine A did not suppress <mark>cytochrome c</mark> release.
<mark>SubAB</mark> did not change the expression of anti-apoptotic <mark>Bcl-2</mark> or <mark>Bcl-XL</mark> and pro-apoptotic <mark>Bax</mark> or <mark>Bak</mark>, but triggered <mark>Bax</mark> and <mark>Bak</mark> conformational changes and association of <mark>Bax</mark> with <mark>Bak</mark>.
Silencing using siRNA of both <mark>bax</mark> and <mark>bak</mark> genes, but not <mark>bax</mark>, <mark>bak</mark>, or bim alone, resulted in reduction of <mark>cytochrome c</mark> release, <mark>caspase-3</mark> activation, DNA ladder formation and cytotoxicity, indicating that <mark>Bax</mark> and <mark>Bak</mark> were involved in apoptosis.
<mark>SubAB</mark> activated ER transmembrane transducers, <mark>Ire1alpha</mark>, and <mark>cJun N-terminal kinase</mark> (<mark>JNK</mark>), and induced <mark>C/EBF-homologue protein</mark> (<mark>CHOP</mark>).
To investigate whether these signals were involved in <mark>cytochrome c</mark> release by <mark>Bax</mark> activation, we silenced <mark>ire1alpha</mark>, <mark>jnk</mark> or <mark>chop</mark>; however, silencing did not decrease <mark>SubAB</mark>-induced <mark>cytochrome c</mark> release, suggesting that these signals were not necessary for <mark>SubAB</mark>-induced mitochondrial permeabilization by <mark>Bax</mark> activation.
The timing of perinatal hypoxia/ischemia events in term neonates: a retrospective autopsy study.
<mark>HSPs</mark>, <mark>ORP-150</mark> and <mark>COX2</mark> are reliable markers to classify acute, perinatal events.
BACKGROUND: The understanding of the cellular responses implicated in perinatal brain damages and the characterization of the various mechanisms involved might open new horizons for understanding the time of onset of a brain hypoxic-ischemic lesion and for effective therapeutic strategies.
METHODS: We performed an immunohistochemical investigation on brain and brainstem sections of 47 peripartum deaths.
The gradation and localization of the expression of antibodies such as <mark>TNFalpha</mark>, <mark>IL-1beta</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>HSPs</mark>, <mark>beta APP</mark>, anti-<mark>TrypH</mark>, <mark>GAP43</mark>, <mark>GFAP</mark>, <mark>COX2</mark>, <mark>ORP-150</mark>, could be correlated with an hypoxic-ischemic damage to document a significant correlation between response and the time of onset acute (</=8 hs) or non-acute (>/=8 hs </=48 hs).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: In non-acute cases <mark>HSP70</mark> reaction was prominent in the neuron cytoplasm, while in acute cases a mild reaction was evident in sporadic fields.
<mark>HSP90</mark> exhibited a similar pattern of positivity as <mark>HSP70</mark>.
In acute group, <mark>ORP150</mark> expressed an intense reaction showing a granular pattern in the cytoplasm of the neurons in the cortex of the infarcted areas.
In non-acute group the positive reaction was more intense in astrocytes and less extended in neurons.
<mark>COX2</mark> reaction exhibited the strongest positive reaction in the neuronal cell bodies of acute cases, while a immunolabeling was prominent in the glial cytoplasm in the non-acute cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Chaperones <mark>HSP70 and 90</mark>, <mark>ORP-150</mark> reaction, and <mark>COX2</mark> protein, have provided very interesting results.
These results would suggest to the clinicians to extend the differential diagnosis of a too large perinatal hypoxic-ischemic insult category to delineate a more accurate chronological judgement.
<mark>Themis2</mark>/<mark>ICB1</mark> is a signaling scaffold that selectively regulates macrophage <mark>Toll-like receptor</mark> signaling and <mark>cytokine</mark> production.
BACKGROUND: <mark>Thymocyte expressed molecule involved in selection 1</mark> (<mark>Themis1</mark>, SwissProt accession number Q8BGW0) is the recently characterised founder member of a novel family of proteins.
A second member of this family, <mark>Themis2</mark> (Q91YX0), also known as <mark>ICB1</mark> (<mark>Induced on contact with basement membrane 1</mark>), remains unreported at the protein level despite microarray and EST databases reporting <mark>Themis2</mark> mRNA expression in B cells and macrophages.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we characterise <mark>Themis2</mark> protein for the first time and show that it acts as a macrophage signalling scaffold, exerting a receptor-, mediator- and signalling pathway-specific effect on <mark>TLR</mark> responses in RAW 264.7 macrophages.
<mark>Themis2</mark> over-expression enhanced the LPS-induced production of <mark>TNF</mark> but not <mark>IL-6</mark> or <mark>Cox-2</mark>, nor <mark>TNF</mark> production induced by ligands for <mark>TLR2</mark> (PAM3) or <mark>TLR3</mark> (poly IratioC).
Moreover, LPS-induced activation of the <mark>MAP kinases</mark> <mark>ERK</mark> and <mark>p38</mark> was enhanced in cells over-expressing <mark>Themis2</mark> whereas the activation of <mark>JNK</mark>, <mark>IRF3</mark> or <mark>NF-kappaB p65</mark>, was unaffected.
Depletion of <mark>Themis2</mark> protein by RNA inteference inhibited LPS-induced <mark>TNF</mark> production in primary human macrophages demonstrating a requirement for <mark>Themis2</mark> in this event.
<mark>Themis2</mark> was inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated upon LPS challenge and interacted with <mark>Lyn kinase</mark> (P25911), the <mark>Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor</mark>, <mark>Vav</mark> (P27870), and the adaptor protein <mark>Grb2</mark> (Q60631).
Mutation of either tyrosine 660 or a proline-rich sequence (PPPRPPK) simultaneously interrupted this complex and reduced by approximately 50% the capacity of <mark>Themis2</mark> to promote LPS-induced <mark>TNF</mark> production.
Finally, <mark>Themis2</mark> protein expression was induced during macrophage development from murine bone marrow precursors and was regulated by inflammatory stimuli both in vitro and in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We hypothesise that <mark>Themis2</mark> may constitute a novel, physiological control point in macrophage inflammatory responses.
Activation of the <mark>JNK</mark> signalling pathway by <mark>macrophage migration inhibitory factor</mark> (<mark>MIF</mark>) and dependence on <mark>CXCR4</mark> and <mark>CD74</mark>.
<mark>c-Jun N-terminal kinase</mark> (<mark>JNK</mark>) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (<mark>MAPK</mark>) family and controls essential processes such as inflammation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis.
<mark>JNK</mark> signalling is triggered by extracellular signals such as cytokines and environmental stresses.
<mark>Macrophage migration inhibitory factor</mark> (<mark>MIF</mark>) is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine with chemokine-like functions in leukocyte recruitment and atherosclerosis.
<mark>MIF</mark> promotes <mark>MAPK</mark> signalling through <mark>ERK1/2</mark>, while it can either activate or inhibit <mark>JNK</mark> phosphorylation, depending on the cell type and underlying stimulation context.
<mark>MIF</mark> activities are mediated by non-cognate interactions with the CXC chemokine receptors <mark>CXCR2</mark> and <mark>CXCR4</mark> or by ligation of <mark>CD74</mark>, which is the cell surface expressed form of the class II invariant chain.
<mark>ERK1/2</mark> signalling stimulated by <mark>MIF</mark> is dependent on <mark>CD74</mark>, but the receptor pathway involved in <mark>MIF</mark> activation of the <mark>JNK</mark> pathway is unknown.
Here we comprehensively characterize the stimulatory effect of <mark>MIF</mark> on the canonical <mark>JNK</mark>/<mark>c-Jun</mark>/<mark>AP-1</mark> pathway in fibroblasts and T cell lines and identify the upstream signalling components.
Physiological concentrations of recombinant <mark>MIF</mark> triggered the phosphorylation of <mark>JNK</mark> and <mark>c-Jun</mark> and rapidly activated <mark>AP-1</mark>.
In T cells, <mark>MIF</mark>-mediated activation of the <mark>JNK</mark> pathway led to upregulated gene expression of the inflammatory chemokine <mark>CXCL8</mark>.
Activation of <mark>JNK</mark> signalling by <mark>MIF</mark> involved the upstream kinases <mark>PI3K</mark> and <mark>SRC</mark> and was found to be dependent on <mark>CXCR4</mark> and <mark>CD74</mark>.
Together, these data show that the <mark>CXCR4</mark>/<mark>CD74</mark>/<mark>SRC</mark>/<mark>PI3K</mark> axis mediates a rapid and transient activation of the <mark>JNK</mark> pathway as triggered by the inflammatory cytokine <mark>MIF</mark> in T cells and fibroblasts.
No evidence of altered alveolar macrophage polarization, but reduced expression of <mark>TLR2</mark>, in bronchoalveolar lavage cells in sarcoidosis.
BACKGROUND: Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous inflammatory disease, possibly of infectious aetiology.
We aimed to investigate whether the degree of functional polarization of alveolar macrophages (AMs), or <mark>Toll-like receptor</mark> (<mark>TLR</mark>) expression, is associated with sarcoidosis or with distinct clinical manifestations of this disease.
METHODS: Total BAL cells (cultured four or 24 h in medium, or stimulated 24 h with LPS) from 14 patients and six healthy subjects, sorted AMs from 22 patients (Lofgren's syndrome n = 11) and 11 healthy subjects, and sorted <mark>CD4</mark>+ T cells from 26 patients (Lofgren's syndrome n = 13) and seven healthy subjects, were included.
Using real-time PCR, the relative gene expression of <mark>IL-10</mark>, <mark>IL-12p35</mark>, <mark>IL-12p40</mark>, <mark>IL-23p19</mark>, <mark>CCR2</mark>, <mark>CCR7</mark>, <mark>iNOS</mark>, <mark>CXCL10</mark>, <mark>CXCL11</mark>, <mark>CXCL16</mark>, <mark>CCL18</mark>, <mark>CCL20</mark>, <mark>CD80</mark>, and <mark>CD86</mark>, and innate immune receptors <mark>TLR2</mark>, <mark>TLR4</mark>, and <mark>TLR9</mark>, was quantified in sorted AMs, and for selected genes in total BAL cells, while <mark>IL-17A</mark> was quantified in T cells.
RESULTS: We did not find evidence of a difference with regard to alveolar macrophage M1/M2 polarization between sarcoidosis patients and healthy controls.
<mark>TLR2</mark> gene expression was significantly lower in sorted AMs from patients, particular in Lofgren's patients.
<mark>CCL18</mark> gene expression in AMs was significantly higher in patients compared to controls.
Additionally, the <mark>IL-17A</mark> expression was lower in Lofgren's patients' <mark>CD4</mark>+ T cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was no evidence for alveolar macrophage polarization in sarcoidosis.
However, there was a reduced <mark>TLR2</mark> mRNA expression in patients with Lofgren's syndrome, which may be of relevance for macrophage interactions with a postulated sarcoidosis pathogen, and for the characteristics of the ensuing T cell response.
<mark>TLR1/2</mark>, <mark>TLR7</mark>, and <mark>TLR9</mark> signals directly activate human peripheral blood naive and memory B cell subsets to produce <mark>cytokines</mark>, <mark>chemokines</mark>, and hematopoietic growth factors.
Recently, it has been reported that using multiple signals, murine and human B cells secrete several <mark>cytokines</mark> with pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties.
We present the first comprehensive analysis of 24 <mark>cytokines</mark>, <mark>chemokines</mark>, and hematopoietic growth factors production by purified human peripheral blood B cells (<mark>CD19</mark>+), and naive (<mark>CD19</mark>+<mark>CD27</mark>-) and memory (<mark>CD19</mark>+<mark>CD27</mark>+) B cells in response to direct and exclusive signaling provided by <mark>toll-like receptor</mark> (<mark>TLR</mark>) ligands Pam3CSK (<mark>TLR1</mark>/<mark>TLR2</mark>), Imiquimod (<mark>TLR7</mark>), and GpG-ODN2006 (<mark>TLR9</mark>).
All three TLR ligands stimulated B cells (<mark>CD19</mark>+) to produce <mark>cytokines</mark> <mark>IL-1α</mark>, <mark>IL-1β</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>TNF-α</mark>, <mark>IL-13</mark>, and <mark>IL-10</mark>, and <mark>chemokines</mark> <mark>MIP-1α</mark>, <mark>MIP-1β</mark>, <mark>MCP-1</mark>, <mark>IP-10</mark>, and <mark>IL-8</mark>.
However, <mark>GM-CSF</mark> and <mark>G-CSF</mark> production was predominantly induced by <mark>TLR2</mark> agonist.
Most <mark>cytokines</mark>/<mark>chemokines</mark>/hematopoietic growth factors were predominantly or exclusively produced by memory B cells, and in general, <mark>TLR2</mark> signal was more powerful than signal provided via<mark>TLR7</mark> and <mark>TLR9</mark>.
No significant secretion of <mark>eotaxin</mark>, <mark>IFN-α</mark>, <mark>IFN-γ</mark>, <mark>IL-2</mark>, <mark>IL-3</mark>, <mark>IL-4</mark>, <mark>IL-5</mark>, <mark>IL-7</mark>, <mark>IL-15</mark>, <mark>IL-17</mark>, <mark>IL-12p40</mark>, <mark>IL-12p70</mark>, and <mark>TNF-β</mark> (<mark>lymphotoxin</mark>) was observed.
These data demonstrate that human B cells can be directly activated via<mark>TLR1</mark>/<mark>TLR2</mark>, <mark>TLR7</mark>, and <mark>TLR9</mark> to induce secretion of <mark>cytokines</mark>, <mark>chemokines</mark>, and hematopoietic growth factors and suggest a role of B cells in immune response against microbial pathogenesis and immune homeostasis.
Microparticles carrying <mark>Sonic hedgehog</mark> favor neovascularization through the activation of nitric oxide pathway in mice.
BACKGROUND: Microparticles (MPs) are vesicles released from plasma membrane upon cell activation and during apoptosis.
Human T lymphocytes undergoing activation and apoptosis generate MPs bearing morphogen <mark>Shh</mark> (MPs(<mark>Shh</mark>+)) that are able to regulate in vitro angiogenesis.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we investigated the ability of MPs(<mark>Shh</mark>+) to modulate neovascularization in a model of mouse hind limb ischemia.
Mice were treated in vivo for 21 days with vehicle, MPs(<mark>Shh</mark>+), MPs(<mark>Shh</mark>+) plus cyclopamine or cyclopamine alone, an inhibitor of <mark>Shh</mark> signalling.
Laser doppler analysis revealed that the recovery of the blood flow was 1.4 fold higher in MPs(<mark>Shh</mark>+)-treated mice than in controls, and this was associated with an activation of <mark>Shh</mark> pathway in muscles and an increase in NO production in both aorta and muscles.
MPs(<mark>Shh</mark>+)-mediated effects on flow recovery and NO production were completely prevented when <mark>Shh</mark> signalling was inhibited by cyclopamine.
In aorta, MPs(<mark>Shh</mark>+) increased activation of <mark>eNOS</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> pathway, and <mark>VEGF</mark> expression, being inhibited by cyclopamine.
By contrast, in muscles, MPs(<mark>Shh</mark>+) enhanced <mark>eNOS</mark> expression and phosphorylation and decreased <mark>caveolin-1</mark> expression, but cyclopamine prevented only the effects of MPs(<mark>Shh</mark>+) on <mark>eNOS</mark> pathway.
Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that MPs(<mark>Shh</mark>+) treatment increased <mark>FGF5</mark>, <mark>FGF2</mark>, <mark>VEGF A and C</mark> mRNA levels and decreased those of <mark>alpha5-integrin</mark>, <mark>FLT-4</mark>, <mark>HGF</mark>, <mark>IGF-1</mark>, <mark>KDR</mark>, <mark>MCP-1</mark>, <mark>MT1-MMP</mark>, <mark>MMP-2</mark>, <mark>TGFbeta1</mark>, <mark>TGFbeta2</mark>, <mark>TSP-1</mark> and <mark>VCAM-1</mark>, in ischemic muscles.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that MPs(<mark>Shh</mark>+) may contribute to reparative neovascularization after ischemic injury by regulating NO pathway and genes involved in angiogenesis.
Severe polyposis in <mark>Apc</mark>(1322T) mice is associated with submaximal <mark>Wnt</mark> signalling and increased expression of the stem cell marker <mark>Lgr5</mark>.
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <mark>Adenomatous polyposis coli</mark> (<mark>APC</mark>) is a tumour suppressor gene mutated in the germline of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and somatically in most colorectal cancers.
<mark>APC</mark> mutations impair <mark>β-catenin</mark> degradation, resulting in increased <mark>Wnt</mark> signalling.
The most frequent <mark>APC</mark> mutation is a codon 1309 truncation that is associated with severe FAP.
A previous study compared two mouse models of intestinal tumorigenesis, <mark>Apc</mark>(R850X) (Min) and <mark>Apc</mark>(1322T) (1322T), the latter a model of human codon 1309 changes.
1322T mice had more severe polyposis but, surprisingly, these tumours had lower levels of nuclear <mark>β-catenin</mark> than Min tumours.
The consequences of these different <mark>β-catenin</mark> levels were investigated.
METHODS: Enterocytes were isolated from 1322T and Min tumours by microdissection and gene expression profiling was performed.
Differentially expressed <mark>Wnt</mark> targets and other stem cell markers were validated using quantitative PCR, in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: As expected, lower nuclear <mark>β-catenin</mark> levels in 1322T lesions were associated with generally lower levels of <mark>Wnt</mark> target expression.
However, expression of the <mark>Wnt</mark> target and stem cell marker <mark>Lgr5</mark> was significantly higher in 1322T tumours than in Min tumours.
Other stem cell markers (<mark>Musashi1</mark>, <mark>Bmi1</mark> and the <mark>Wnt</mark> target <mark>Cd44</mark>) were also at higher levels in 1322T tumours.
In addition, expression of the <mark>Bmp</mark> antagonist <mark>Gremlin1</mark> was higher in 1322T tumours, together with lower <mark>Bmp2</mark> and <mark>Bmp4</mark> expression.
CONCLUSIONS: The severe phenotype caused by truncation of <mark>Apc</mark> at codon 1322 is associated with an increased number of stem cells.
Thus, a submaximal level of <mark>Wnt</mark> signalling favours the stem cell phenotype and this may promote tumorigenesis.
A level of <mark>Wnt</mark> signalling exists that is too high for optimal tumour growth.
Phylogenetic and developmental study of <mark>CD4</mark>, <mark>CD8 alpha and beta</mark> T cell co-receptor homologs in two amphibian species, Xenopus tropicalis and Xenopus laevis.
<mark>CD4</mark> and <mark>CD8</mark> co-receptors play critical roles in T cell development and activation by interacting both with <mark>T cell receptors</mark> and <mark>MHC</mark> molecules.
Although homologs of these genes have been identified in many jawed vertebrates, there are still unresolved gaps concerning their evolution and specialization in <mark>MHC</mark> interaction and T cell function.
Using experimental and computational procedures we identified <mark>CD4</mark>, <mark>CD8alpha</mark> and <mark>CD8beta</mark> gene homologs both in Xenopus tropicalis, whose full genome has been sequenced, and its sister species Xenopus laevis.
Multiple alignments of deduced amino acid sequences reveal a poor conservation of the residues involved in binding of <mark>CD4</mark> to <mark>MHC class II</mark>, and <mark>CD8alpha</mark> to <mark>class I</mark> in non-mammalian species, presumably related to the co-evolutionary pressure of <mark>MHC I and II</mark> genes.
Phylogenetic study suggests that Xenopodinae co-receptor genes are more closely related to their homologs in other tetrapods than those of bony fish.
Furthermore, the developmental and cell-specific expression patterns of these genes in X. laevis are very similar to that of mammals.
X. laevis <mark>CD4</mark> is mainly expressed by peripheral non-<mark>CD8</mark> T cells and detected in the thymus as early as four days post-fertilization (dpf) at the onset of thymic organogenesis.
<mark>CD8beta</mark> expression is specific to adult surface <mark>CD8</mark>(+) T cells and thymocytes, and is first detected in the thymus at 5 dpf in parallel with productive <mark>TCRgamma</mark> transrcipts, whereas productive <mark>TCRbeta and alpha</mark> rearrangements are not detected before 7-9 dpf.
Comparative transcriptome profiling analyses during the lag phase uncover <mark>YAP1</mark>, <mark>PDR1</mark>, <mark>PDR3</mark>, <mark>RPN4</mark>, and <mark>HSF1</mark> as key regulatory genes in genomic adaptation to the lignocellulose derived inhibitor HMF for Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
BACKGROUND: The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to adapt and in situ detoxify lignocellulose derived inhibitors such as furfural and HMF.
The length of lag phase for cell growth in response to the inhibitor challenge has been used to measure tolerance of strain performance.
Mechanisms of yeast tolerance at the genome level remain unknown.
Using systems biology approach, this study investigated comparative transcriptome profiling, metabolic profiling, cell growth response, and gene regulatory interactions of yeast strains and selective gene deletion mutations in response to HMF challenges during the lag phase of growth.
RESULTS: We identified 365 candidate genes and found at least 3 significant components involving some of these genes that enable yeast adaptation and tolerance to HMF in yeast.
First, functional enzyme coding genes such as <mark>ARI1</mark>, <mark>ADH6</mark>, <mark>ADH7</mark>, and <mark>OYE3</mark>, as well as gene interactions involved in the biotransformation and inhibitor detoxification were the direct driving force to reduce HMF damages in cells.
Expressions of these genes were regulated by <mark>YAP1</mark> and its closely related regulons.
Second, a large number of <mark>PDR genes</mark>, mainly regulated by <mark>PDR1</mark> and <mark>PDR3</mark>, were induced during the lag phase and the <mark>PDR gene</mark> family-centered functions, including specific and multiple functions involving cellular transport such as <mark>TPO1</mark>, <mark>TPO4</mark>, <mark>RSB1</mark>, <mark>PDR5</mark>, <mark>PDR15</mark>, <mark>YOR1</mark>, and <mark>SNQ2</mark>, promoted cellular adaptation and survival in order to cope with the inhibitor stress.
Third, expressed genes involving degradation of damaged proteins and protein modifications such as <mark>SHP1</mark> and <mark>SSA4</mark>, regulated by <mark>RPN4</mark>, <mark>HSF1</mark>, and other co-regulators, were necessary for yeast cells to survive and adapt the HMF stress.
A deletion mutation strain Deltarpn4 was unable to recover the growth in the presence of HMF.
CONCLUSIONS: Complex gene interactions and regulatory networks as well as co-regulations exist in yeast adaptation and tolerance to the lignocellulose derived inhibitor HMF.
Both induced and repressed genes involving diversified functional categories are accountable for adaptation and energy rebalancing in yeast to survive and adapt the HMF stress during the lag phase of growth.
Transcription factor genes <mark>YAP1</mark>, <mark>PDR1</mark>, <mark>PDR3</mark>, <mark>RPN4</mark>, and <mark>HSF1</mark> appeared to play key regulatory rules for global adaptation in the yeast S. cerevisiae.
Localization of a <mark>guanylyl cyclase</mark> to chemosensory cilia requires the novel ciliary <mark>MYND</mark> domain protein <mark>DAF-25</mark>.
In harsh conditions, Caenorhabditis elegans arrests development to enter a non-aging, resistant diapause state called the dauer larva.
Olfactory sensation modulates the <mark>TGF-beta</mark> and <mark>insulin</mark> signaling pathways to control this developmental decision.
Four mutant alleles of <mark>daf-25</mark> (abnormal DAuer Formation) were isolated from screens for mutants exhibiting constitutive dauer formation and found to be defective in olfaction.
The <mark>daf-25</mark> dauer phenotype is suppressed by <mark>daf-10</mark>/<mark>IFT122</mark> mutations (which disrupt ciliogenesis), but not by <mark>daf-6</mark>/<mark>PTCHD3</mark> mutations (which prevent environmental exposure of sensory cilia), implying that <mark>DAF-25</mark> functions in the cilia themselves.
<mark>daf-25</mark> encodes the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian <mark>Ankmy2</mark>, a <mark>MYND</mark> domain protein of unknown function.
Disruption of <mark>DAF-25</mark>, which localizes to sensory cilia, produces no apparent cilia structure anomalies, as determined by light and electron microscopy.
Hinting at its potential function, the dauer phenotype, epistatic order, and expression profile of <mark>daf-25</mark> are similar to <mark>daf-11</mark>, which encodes a cilium-localized <mark>guanylyl cyclase</mark>.
Indeed, we demonstrate that <mark>DAF-25</mark> is required for proper <mark>DAF-11</mark> ciliary localization.
Furthermore, the functional interaction is evolutionarily conserved, as mouse <mark>Ankmy2</mark> interacts with <mark>guanylyl cyclase</mark> <mark>GC1</mark> from ciliary photoreceptors.
The interaction may be specific because <mark>daf-25</mark> mutants have normally-localized <mark>OSM-9</mark>/<mark>TRPV4</mark>, <mark>TAX-4</mark>/<mark>CNGA1</mark>, <mark>CHE-2</mark>/<mark>IFT80</mark>, <mark>CHE-11</mark>/<mark>IFT140</mark>, <mark>CHE-13</mark>/<mark>IFT57</mark>, <mark>BBS-8</mark>, <mark>OSM-5</mark>/<mark>IFT88</mark>, and <mark>XBX-1</mark>/<mark>D2LIC</mark> in the cilia.
Intraflagellar transport (IFT) (required to build cilia) is not defective in <mark>daf-25</mark> mutants, although the ciliary localization of <mark>DAF-25</mark> itself is influenced in <mark>che-11</mark> mutants, which are defective in retrograde IFT.
In summary, we have discovered a novel ciliary protein that plays an important role in cGMP signaling by localizing a <mark>guanylyl cyclase</mark> to the sensory organelle.
<mark>Bone morphogenetic protein 4</mark> (<mark>BMP4</mark>) signaling in retinoblastoma cells.
<mark>Bone morphogenetic proteins</mark> (<mark>BMPs</mark>) - expressed in the developing retina - are known to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis in several tumor entities.
The objective of this study was to determine the role of the <mark>BMP4</mark> pathway in retinoblastoma cells, which are absent in a functional <mark>retinoblastoma (RB1) gene</mark>.
<mark>BMP receptors</mark> were detected in all retinoblastoma cell lines investigated.
A correct transmission of <mark>BMP</mark> signaling via the <mark>Smad1/5/8</mark> pathway could be demonstrated in WERI-<mark>Rb1</mark> retinoblastoma cells and application of recombinant human <mark>BMP4</mark> resulted in an increase in apoptosis, which to a large extend is <mark>caspase</mark> independent.
Cell proliferation was not affected by <mark>BMP4</mark> signaling, although the p<mark>Rb</mark>-related proteins <mark>p107</mark> and <mark>p130</mark>, contributing to the regulation of the same genes, are still expressed.
WERI-<mark>Rb1</mark> cells exhibit elevated endogenous levels of <mark>p21</mark>(<mark>CIP1</mark>) and <mark>p53</mark>, but we did not detect any increase in <mark>p53</mark>, <mark>p21</mark>(<mark>CIP1</mark>)or <mark>p27(KIP1)</mark> expression levels.
<mark>Id proteins</mark> became, however, strongly up-regulated upon exogenous <mark>BMP4</mark> treatment.
Thus, <mark>RB1</mark> loss in WERI-<mark>Rb1</mark> cells is obviously not compensated for by p<mark>Rb</mark>-independent (e.g. <mark>p53</mark>-dependent) cell cycle control mechanisms, preventing an anti-proliferative response to <mark>BMP4</mark>, which normally induces cell cycle arrest.
The <mark>kinesin<mark>kinesin</mark>amily protein</mark> <mark>KIF17</mark> is regulated by the same <mark>transcription factor</mark> (<mark>NRF-1</mark>) as its cargo <mark>NR2B</mark> in neurons.
The <mark>kinesin</mark> superfamily of motor proteins is known to be <mark>ATP-dependent transporters</mark> of various types of cargoes.
In neurons, <mark>KIF17</mark> is found to transport vesicles containing the <mark>N-methy<mark>N-methyl-D-aspartate recepto</mark>> <mark>NR2B</mark> subunit from the cell body specifically to the dendrites.
These subunits are intimately associated with glutamatergic neurotransmission as well as with learning and memory.
Glutamatergic synapses are highly energy-dependent, and recently we found that the same transcription factor, <mark>nuclear respiratory factor 1</mark> (<mark>NRF-1</mark>), co-regulates energy metabolism (via its regulation of <mark>cytochrome c oxidase</mark> and other mitochondrial enzymes) and neurochemicals of glutamatergic transmission (<mark>NR1</mark>, <mark>NR2B</mark>, <mark>GluR2</mark>, and <mark>nNOS</mark>).
The present study tested our hypothesis that <mark>NRF-1</mark> also transcriptionally regulates <mark>KIF17</mark>.
By means of in silico analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays, in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, promoter mutations, and real-time quantitative PCR, we found that <mark>NRF-1</mark> (but not <mark>NRF-2</mark>) functionally regulates <mark>Kif17</mark>, but not <mark>Kif1a</mark>, gene.
<mark>NRF-1</mark> binding sites on <mark>Kif17</mark> gene are highly conserved among mice, rats, and humans.
Silencing of <mark>NRF-1</mark> with small interference RNA blocked the up-regulation of <mark>Kif17</mark> mRNA and proteins (and of <mark>Grin1</mark> and <mark>Grin2b</mark>) induced by KCl-mediated depolarization, whereas over-expressing <mark>NRF-1</mark> rescued these transcripts and proteins from being suppressed by TTX.
Thus, <mark>NRF-1</mark> co-regulates <mark>oxidative enzymes</mark> that generate energy and neurochemicals that consume energy related to glutamatergic neurotransmission, such as <mark>KIF17</mark>, <mark>NR1</mark>, and <mark>NR2B</mark>, thereby ensuring that energy production matches energy utilization at the molecular and cellular levels.
<mark>Brat</mark> promotes stem cell differentiation via control of a bistable switch that restricts <mark>BMP</mark> signaling.
Drosophila ovarian germline stem cells (GSCs) are maintained by <mark>Dpp</mark> signaling and the <mark>Pumilio</mark> (<mark>Pum</mark>) and <mark>Nanos</mark> (<mark>Nos</mark>) translational repressors.
Upon division, <mark>Dpp</mark> signaling is extinguished, and <mark>Nos</mark> is downregulated in one daughter cell, causing it to switch to a differentiating cystoblast (CB).
However, downstream effectors of <mark>Pum</mark>-<mark>Nos</mark> remain unknown, and how CBs lose their responsiveness to <mark>Dpp</mark> is unclear.
Here, we identify <mark>Brain Tumor</mark> (<mark>Brat</mark>) as a potent differentiation factor and target of <mark>Pum</mark>-<mark>Nos</mark> regulation.
<mark>Brat</mark> is excluded from GSCs by <mark>Pum</mark>-<mark>Nos</mark> but functions with <mark>Pum</mark> in CBs to translationally repress distinct targets, including the <mark>Mad</mark> and <mark>dMyc</mark> mRNAs.
Regulation of both targets simultaneously lowers cellular responsiveness to <mark>Dpp</mark> signaling, forcing the cell to become refractory to the self-renewal signal.
Mathematical modeling elucidates bistability of cell fate in the <mark>Brat</mark>-mediated system, revealing how autoregulation of GSC number can arise from <mark>Brat</mark> coupling extracellular <mark>Dpp</mark> regulation to intracellular interpretation.
Renal <mark>pro-apoptotic proteins</mark> are reduced by <mark>growth hormone</mark> resistance but not by visceral fat removal.
<mark>Growth hormone (GH) receptor</mark> knockout (<mark>GHR</mark>KO) mice are highly <mark>insulin</mark> sensitive and long-lived.
Surgical visceral fat removal (VFR) improves <mark>insulin</mark> signaling in normal mice and rats and extends longevity in rats.
We have previously demonstrated decreased expression of certain <mark>pro-apoptotic genes</mark> in kidneys of <mark>GHR</mark>KO mice and suggested that this could contribute to the increased longevity of these animals.
The aim of the present study was to examine the level of the following proteins: <mark>caspase-3</mark>, <mark>caspase-9</mark>, <mark>caspase-8</mark>, <mark>bax</mark>, <mark>bad</mark>, <mark>phospho-bad</ma<mark>bad</mark>, <mark>bcl-2</mark>, <mark>Smac</mark>/<mark>DIABLO</mark>, <mark>Apaf-1</mark>, <mark>phospho-p53</ma<mark>p53</mark> (<mark>pp53</ma<mark>p53</mark>) and <mark>cytochrome c</mark> in male <mark>GHR</mark>KO and normal (N) mice subjected to VFR or sham surgery, at approximately six months of age.
The kidneys were collected two months after VFR.
<mark>Caspase-3</mark>, <mark>caspase-8</mark>, <mark>bax</mark>, <mark>bad</mark>, <mark>Smac</mark>/<mark>DIABLO</mark>, <mark>Apaf-1</mark> and <mark>pp53</ma<mark>p53</mark> levels were decreased in <mark>GHR</mark>KO mice as compared to N animals.
VFR did not change the level of any of the examined proteins.
The decreased renal levels of <mark>pro-apoptotic proteins</mark> could contribute to the extended life-span caused by targeted disruption of the <mark>GH receptor</mark> gene but are apparently not involved in mediating the effects of VFR.
Deletion of <mark>growth hormone receptor</mark> gene but not visceral fat removal decreases expression of <mark>apoptosis-related genes</mark> in the kidney-potential mechanism of lifespan extension.
Mice homozygous for the targeted disruption of the <mark>growth hormone (GH) receptor</mark> (<mark>Ghr</mark>) gene (<mark>GH receptor</mark> knockout; <mark>GHR</mark>KO; KO) are hypoinsulinemic, highly <mark>insulin</mark> sensitive, normoglycemic, and long-lived.
Visceral fat removal (VFR) is a surgical intervention which improves <mark>insulin</mark> signaling in normal (N) mice and rats and extends longevity in rats.
We have previously demonstrated decreased expression level of certain <mark>pro-apoptotic genes</mark> in skeletal muscles and suggested that this may contribute to the regulation of longevity in <mark>GHR</mark>KO mice.
Alterations in <mark>apoptosis-related genes</mark> expression in the kidneys also may potentially lead to lifespan extension.
In this context, we decided to examine the renal expression of the following genes: <mark>caspase-3</mark>, <mark>caspase-9</mark>, <mark>caspase-8</mark>, <mark>bax</mark>, <mark>bad</mark>, <mark>bcl-2</mark>, <mark>Smac</mark>/<mark>DIABLO</mark>, <mark>Apaf-1</mark>, <mark>p53</mark>, and <mark>cytochrome c1</mark> (<mark>cyc1</mark>) in male <mark>GHR</mark>KO and N mice subjected to VFR or sham surgery, at approximately 6 months of age.
The kidneys were collected 2 months after VFR.
As a result, <mark>caspase-3</mark>, <mark>caspase-9</mark>, and <mark>bax</mark> expressions were decreased in KO mice as compared to N animals.
Expressions of <mark>Smac</mark>/<mark>DIABLO</mark>, <mark>caspase-8</mark>, <mark>bcl-2</mark>, <mark>bad</mark>, and <mark>p53</mark> did not differ between KOs and N mice.
VFR did not change the expression of the examined genes in KO or N mice.
In conclusion, endocrine abnormalities in <mark>GHR</mark>KO mice result in decreased expression of <mark>pro-apoptotic genes</mark> and VFR did not alter the examined genes expression in N and KO mice.
These data are consistent with a model in which alterations of <mark>GH</mark> signaling and/or <mark>insulin</mark> sensitivity lead to increased lifespan mediated by decreased renal expression of <mark>pro-apoptotic genes</mark>.
<mark>IL-1α</mark> mediated chorioamnionitis induces depletion of <mark>FoxP3</mark>+ cells and ileal inflammation in the ovine fetal gut.
BACKGROUND: Endotoxin induced chorioamnionitis increases <mark>IL-1</mark> and provokes an inflammatory response in the fetal ileum that interferes with intestinal maturation.
In the present study, we tested in an ovine chorioamnionitis model whether <mark>IL-1</mark> is a major <mark>cytokine</mark> driving the inflammatory response in the fetal ileum.
METHOD: Sheep bearing singleton fetuses received a single intraamniotic injection of recombinant ovine <mark>IL-1α</mark> at 7, 3 or 1 d before caesarian delivery at 125 days gestational age (term = 150 days).
RESULTS: 3 and 7 d after <mark>IL-1α</mark> administration, intestinal mRNA levels for <mark>IL-4</mark>, <mark>IL-10</mark>, <mark>IFN-γ</mark> and <mark>TNF-α</mark> were strongly elevated.
Numbers of <mark>CD3</mark>+ and <mark>CD4</mark>+ T-lymphocytes and <mark>myeloidperoxidase</mark>+ cells were increased whereas <mark>FoxP3</mark>+ T-cells were detected at low frequency.
This increased proinflammatory state was associated with ileal mucosal barrier loss as demonstrated by decreased levels of the <mark>intestinal fatty acid binding protein</mark> and disruption of the <mark>tight junctional protein</mark> <mark>ZO-1</mark>.
CONCLUSION: Intraamniotic <mark>IL-1α</mark> causes an acute detrimental inflammatory response in the ileum, suggesting that induction of <mark>IL-1</mark> is a critical element in the pathophysiological effects of endotoxin induced chorioamnionitis.
A disturbed balance between T-effector and <mark>FoxP3</mark>+ cells may contribute to this process.
Aberrant expression of costimulatory molecules in splenocytes of the <mark>mevalonate kinase</mark>-deficient mouse model of human hyper-<mark>IgD</mark> syndrome (HIDS).
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the activation status and proliferative capacities of splenic lymphocyte populations from a <mark>mevalonate kinase</mark>-deficient mouse model of hyper-<mark>IgD</mark> syndrome (HIDS).
We previously reported that murine <mark>mevalonate kinase</mark> gene ablation was embryonic lethal for homozygous mutants while heterozygotes (<mark>Mvk</mark> (+/-)) demonstrated several phenotypic features of human HIDS including increased serum levels of <mark>IgD</mark>, <mark>IgA</mark>, and <mark>TNFα</mark>, temperature dysregulation, hematological abnormalities, and splenomegaly.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Flow cytometric analysis of cell surface activation markers on T and B lymphocytes, and macrophage populations, demonstrated aberrant expression of <mark>B7 glycoproteins</mark> in all splenic cell types studied.
Differences in expression levels between <mark>Mvk</mark> (+/-) and <mark>Mvk</mark> (+/+) littermate controls were observed in both the basal state (unstimulated) and after Concanavalin A (Con-A) stimulation in vitro of whole splenocyte cultures.
In <mark>Mvk</mark> (+/-) <mark>CD4</mark> and <mark>CD8</mark> T cells, alterations in expression of <mark>CD25</mark>, <mark>CD80</mark>, <mark>CD152</mark>, and <mark>CD28</mark> were observed.
<mark>Mvk</mark> (+/-) splenic macrophages expressed altered levels of <mark>CD80</mark>, <mark>CD86</mark>, <mark>CD40</mark>, and <mark>CD11c</mark> while <mark>Mvk</mark> (+/-) B lymphocytes had differential expression of <mark>CD40</mark>, <mark>CD80</mark>, and <mark>CD86</mark>.
<mark>Mvk</mark> (+/-) splenocyte subpopulations also exhibited altered proliferative capacities in response to in vitro stimulation.
CONCLUSION: We postulate that imbalances in the expression of cell surface proteins necessary for activation, proliferation, and regulation of the intensity and duration of an immune response may result in defective T cell activation, proliferation, and effector functions in our model and potentially in human HIDS.
<mark>Oxidized LDL receptor 1</mark> (<mark>OLR1</mark>) as a possible link between obesity, dyslipidemia and cancer.
Recent studies have linked expression of <mark>lectin-like ox-LDL receptor 1</mark> (<mark>OLR1</mark>) to tumorigenesis.
We analyzed microarray data from <mark>Olr1</mark> knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice for genes involved in cellular transformation and evaluated effects of <mark>OLR1</mark> over-expression in normal mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) and breast cancer cells (HCC1143) in terms of gene expression, migration, adhesion and transendothelial migration.
Twenty-six out of 238 genes were inhibited in tissues of <mark>OLR1</mark> KO mice; the vast majority of <mark>OLR1</mark> sensitive genes contained <mark>NF-κB</mark> binding sites in their promoters.
Further studies revealed broad inhibition of <mark>NF-kB</mark> target genes outside of the transformation-associated gene pool, with enrichment themes of defense response, immune response, apoptosis, proliferation, and wound healing.
Transcriptome of <mark>Olr1</mark> KO mice also revealed inhibition of de novo lipogenesis, rate-limiting enzymes <mark>fatty acid synthase</mark> (<mark>Fasn</mark>), <mark>stearoyl-CoA desaturase</mark> (<mark>Scd1</mark>) and <mark>ELOVL family member 6</mark> (<mark>Elovl6</mark>), as well as lipolytic <mark>phospholipase A2 group IVB</mark> (<mark>Pla2g4b</mark>).
In studies comparing MCF10A and HCC1143, the latter displayed 60% higher <mark>OLR1</mark> expression.
Forced over-expression of <mark>OLR1</mark> resulted in upregulation of <mark>NF-κB (<mark>NF-κB</mark>/m<mark>p65</mark>> and its target pro-oncogenes involved in inhibition of apoptosis (<mark>BCL2</mark>, <mark>BCL2A1</mark>, <mark>TNFAIP3</mark>) and regulation of cell cycle (<mark>CCND2</mark>) in both cell lines.
Basal expression of <mark>FASN</mark>, <mark>SCD1</mark> and <mark>PLA2G4B</mark>, as well as lipogenesis <mark>transcription factors</mark> <mark>PPARA</mark>, <mark>SREBF2</mark> and <mark>CREM</mark>, was higher in HCC1143 cells.
Over-expression of <mark>OLR1</mark> in HCC1143 cells also enhanced cell migration, without affecting their adherence to <mark>TNFα</mark>-activated endothelium or transendothelial migration.
On the other hand, <mark>OLR1</mark> neutralizing antibody inhibited both adhesion and transmigration of untreated HCC1143 cells.
We conclude that <mark>OLR1</mark> may act as an oncogene by activation of <mark>NF-kB</mark> target genes responsible for proliferation, migration and inhibition of apoptosis and de novo lipogenesis genes.
<mark>COX-2</mark> gene expression in colon cancer tissue related to regulating factors and promoter methylation status.
BACKGROUND: Increased <mark>cyclooxygenase</mark> activity promotes progression of colorectal cancer, but the mechanisms behind <mark>COX-2</mark> induction remain elusive.
This study was therefore aimed to define external cell signaling and <mark>transcription factors</mark> relating to high <mark>COX-2</mark> expression in colon cancer tissue.
METHOD: Tumor and normal colon tissue were collected at primary curative operation in 48 unselected patients.
<mark>COX-2</mark> expression in tumor and normal colon tissue was quantified including microarray analyses on tumor mRNA accounting for high and low tumor <mark>COX-2</mark> expression.
Cross hybridization was performed between tumor and normal colon tissue.
Methylation status of up-stream <mark>COX-2</mark> promoter region was evaluated.
RESULTS: Tumors with high <mark>COX-2</mark> expression displayed large differences in gene expression compared to normal colon.
Numerous genes with altered expression appeared in tumors of high <mark>COX-2</mark> expression compared to tumors of low <mark>COX-2</mark>.
<mark>COX-2</mark> expression in normal colon was increased in patients with tumors of high <mark>COX-2</mark> compared to normal colon from patients with tumors of low <mark>COX-2</mark>.
<mark>IL1beta</mark>, <mark>IL6</mark> and <mark>iNOS</mark> transcripts were up-regulated among external cell signaling factors; nine <mark>transcription factors</mark> (<mark>ATF3</mark>, <mark>C/EBP</mark>, <mark>c-Fos</mark>, <mark>Fos-B</mark>, <mark>JDP2</mark>, <mark>JunB</mark>, <mark>c-Maf</mark>, <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>, <mark>TCF4</mark>) showed increased expression and 5 (<mark>AP-2</mark>, <mark>CBP</mark>, <mark>Elk-1</mark>, <mark>p53</mark>, <mark>PEA3</mark>) were decreased in tumors with high <mark>COX-2</mark>.
The promoter region of <mark>COX-2</mark> gene did not show consistent methylation in tumor or normal colon tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: Transcription and external cell signaling factors are altered as covariates to <mark>COX-2</mark> expression in colon cancer tissue, but DNA methylation of the <mark>COX-2</mark> promoter region was not a significant factor behind <mark>COX-2</mark> expression in tumor and normal colon tissue.
<mark>Notch</mark>, <mark>IL-1</mark> and <mark>leptin</mark> crosstalk outcome (NILCO) is critical for <mark>leptin</mark>-induced proliferation, migration and <mark>VEGF</mark>/<mark>VEGFR-2</mark> expression in breast cancer.
High levels of pro-angiogenic factors, <mark>leptin</mark>, <mark>IL-1</mark>, <mark>Notch</mark> and <mark>VEGF</mark> (ligands and receptors), are found in breast cancer, which is commonly correlated with metastasis and lower survival of patients.
We have previously reported that <mark>leptin</mark> induces the growth of breast cancer and the expression of <mark>VEGF</mark>/<mark>VEGFR-2</mark> and <mark>IL-1</mark> system.
We hypothesized that <mark>Notch</mark>, <mark>IL-1</mark> and <mark>leptin</mark> crosstalk outcome (NILCO) plays an essential role in the regulation of <mark>leptin</mark>-mediated induction of proliferation/migration and expression of pro-angiogenic molecules in breast cancer.
To test this hypothesis, <mark>leptin</mark>'s effects on the expression and activation of <mark>Notch</mark> signaling pathway and <mark>VEGF</mark>/<mark>VEGFR-2</mark>/<mark>IL-1</mark> were determined in mouse (4T1, EMT6 and MMT) breast cancer cells.
Remarkably, <mark>leptin</mark> up-regulated <mark>Notch1-4</mark>/<mark>JAG1</mark>/<mark>Dll-4</mark>, <mark>Notch</mark> target genes: <mark>Hey2</mark> and <mark>survivin</mark>, together with <mark>IL-1</mark> and <mark>VEGF</mark>/<mark>VEGFR-2</mark>.
RNA knockdown and pharmacological inhibitors of <mark>leptin</mark> signaling significantly abrogated activity of reporter gene-<mark>luciferase</mark> <mark>CSL</mark> (<mark>RBP-Jk</mark>) promoter, showing that it was linked to <mark>leptin</mark>-activated <mark>JAK2</mark>/<mark>STAT3</mark>, <mark>MAPK</mark>, <mark>PI-3K</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark>, <mark>p38</mark> and <mark>JNK</mark> signaling pathways.
Interestingly, <mark>leptin</mark> upregulatory effects on cell proliferation/migration and pro-angiogenic factors <mark>Notch</mark>, <mark>IL-1</mark> and <mark>VEGF</mark>/<mark>VEGFR-2</mark> were abrogated by a <mark>gamma-secretase</mark> inhibitor, DAPT, as well as siRNA against <mark>CSL</mark>.
In addition, blockade of <mark>IL-1R tI</mark> inhibited <mark>leptin</mark>-induced <mark>Notch</mark>, <mark>Hey2</mark> and <mark>survivin</mark> as well as <mark>VEGF</mark>/<mark>VEGFR-2</mark> expression.
These data suggest <mark>leptin</mark> is an inducer of <mark>Notch</mark> (expression/activation) and <mark>IL-1</mark> signaling modulates <mark>leptin</mark> effects on <mark>Notch</mark> and <mark>VEGF</mark>/<mark>VEGFR-2</mark>.
We show for the first time that a novel unveiled crosstalk between <mark>Notch</mark>, <mark>IL-1</mark> and <mark>leptin</mark> (NILCO) occurs in breast cancer.
<mark>Leptin</mark> induction of proliferation/migration and upregulation of <mark>VEGF</mark>/<mark>VEGFR-2</mark> in breast cancer cells were related to an intact <mark>Notch</mark> signaling axis.
NILCO could represent the integration of developmental, pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic signals critical for <mark>leptin</mark>-induced cell proliferation/migration and regulation of <mark>VEGF</mark>/<mark>VEGFR-2</mark> in breast cancer.
Targeting NILCO might help to design new pharmacological strategies aimed at controlling breast cancer growth and angiogenesis.
A small peptide modeled after the <mark>NRAGE</mark> repeat domain inhibits <mark>XIAP</mark>-<mark>TAB1</mark>-<mark>TAK1</mark> signaling for <mark>NF-κB</mark> activation and apoptosis in P19 cells.
In normal growth and development, apoptosis is necessary to shape the central nervous system and to eliminate excess neurons which are not required for innervation.
In some diseases, however, apoptosis can be either overactive as in some neurodegenerative disorders or severely attenuated as in the spread of certain cancers.
<mark>Bone morphogenetic proteins</mark> (<mark>BMPs</mark>) transmit signals for regulating cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.
Responding to <mark>BMP receptors</mark> stimulated from <mark>BMP</mark> ligands, <mark>neurotrophin receptor-mediated MAGE homolog</mark> (<mark>NRAGE</mark>) binds and functions with the <mark>XIAP</mark>-<mark>TAK1</mark>-<mark>TAB1</mark> complex to activate <mark>p38(MAPK)</mark> and induces apoptosis in cortical neural progenitors.
<mark>NRAGE</mark> contains a unique repeat domain that is only found in human, mouse, and rat homologs that we theorize is pivotal in its <mark>BMP</mark> <mark>MAPK</mark> role.
Previously, we showed that deletion of the repeat domain inhibits apoptosis, <mark>p38(MAPK)</mark> phosphorylation, and <mark>caspase-3</mark> cleavage in P19 neural progenitor cells.
We also showed that the <mark>XIAP</mark>-<mark>TAB1</mark>-<mark>TAK1</mark> complex is dependent on <mark>NRAGE</mark> for <mark>IKK-α/β</mark> phosphorylation and <mark>NF-κB</mark> activation.
<mark>XIAP</mark> is a major inhibitor of <mark>caspases</mark>, the main executioners of apoptosis.
Although it has been shown previously that <mark>NRAGE</mark> binds to the <mark>RING</mark> domain of <mark>XIAP</mark>, it has not been determined which <mark>NRAGE</mark> domain binds to <mark>XIAP</mark>.
Here, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to determine that there is a strong likelihood of a direct interaction between <mark>NRAGE</mark> and <mark>XIAP</mark> occurring at <mark>NRAGE</mark>'s unique repeat domain which we also attribute to be the domain responsible for downstream signaling of <mark>NF-κB</mark> and activating <mark>IKK</ma<mark>IKK subunits</mark>.
From these results, we designed a small peptide modeled after the <mark>NRAGE</mark> repeat domain which we have determined inhibits <mark>NF-κB</mark> activation and apoptosis in P19 cells.
These intriguing results illustrate that the paradigm of the <mark>NRAGE</mark> repeat domain may hold promising therapeutic strategies in developing pharmaceutical solutions for combating harmful diseases involving excessive downstream <mark>BMP</mark> signaling, including apoptosis.
HIV-1 <mark>Tat</mark> activates <mark>indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase</mark> in murine organotypic hippocampal slice cultures in a <mark>p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase</mark>-dependent manner.
<mark>B</mark>ACKGROUND: We have established that activation of the tryptophan degrading enzyme <mark>indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase</mark> (<mark>IDO</mark>) mediates the switch from <mark>cytokine</mark>-induced sickness behavior to depressive-like behavior.
Because human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) <mark>Tat</mark> protein causes depressive-like behavior in mice, we investigated its ability to activate <mark>IDO</mark> in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) derived from neonatal C57BL/6 mice.
METHODS: Depressive-like behavior in C57BL/6J mice was assessed by the forced swim test.
Expression of <mark>cytokines</mark> and <mark>IDO</mark> mRNA in OHSCs was measured by real-time RT-PCR and <mark>cytokine</mark> protein was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).
<mark>p38 MAPK</mark> phosphorylation was analyzed by western blot.
RESULTS: Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of <mark>Tat</mark> (40 ng) induced depressive-like behavior in the absence of sickness.
Addition of <mark>Tat</mark> (40 ng/slice) to the medium of OHSCs induced <mark>IDO</mark> steady-state mRNA that peaked at 6 h. This effect was potentiated by pretreatment with <mark>IFNγ</mark>.
<mark>Tat</mark> also induced the synthesis and release of <mark>TNFα</mark> and <mark>IL-6</mark> protein in the supernatant of the slices and increased expression of the <mark>inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase</mark> (<mark>iNOS</mark>) and the <mark>serotonin transporter</mark> (<mark>SERT</mark>).
<mark>Tat</mark> had no effect on endogenous synthesis of <mark>IFNγ</mark>.
To explore the mechanisms of <mark>Tat</mark>-induced <mark>IDO</mark> expression, slices were pretreated with the <mark>p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)</mark> inhibitor SB 202190 for 30 min before <mark>Tat</mark> treatment.
SB 202190 significantly decreased <mark>IDO</mark> expression induced by <mark>Tat</mark>, and this effect was accompanied by a reduction of <mark>Tat</mark>-induced expression of <mark>TNFα</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>iNOS</mark> and <mark>SERT</mark>.
CONCLUSION: These data establish that <mark>Tat</mark> induces <mark>IDO</mark> expression via an <mark>IFNγ</mark>-independent mechanism that depends upon activation of <mark>p38 MAPK</mark>.
Targeting <mark>IDO</mark> itself or the <mark>p38 MAPK</mark> signaling pathway could provide a novel therapy for comorbid depressive disorders in HIV-1-infected patients.
Serum <mark>leptin</mark> levels in relation to circulating <mark>cytokines</mark>, <mark>chemokines</mark>, <mark>adhesion molecules</mark> and angiogenic factors in normal pregnancy and preeclampsia.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we determined circulating levels of <mark>C-reactive protein</mark>, several cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and angiogenic factors along with those of <mark>leptin</mark> in healthy non-pregnant and pregnant women and preeclamptic patients, and investigated whether serum <mark>leptin</mark> levels were related to the clinical characteristics and measured laboratory parameters of the study participants.
METHODS: Sixty preeclamptic patients, 60 healthy pregnant women and 59 healthy non-pregnant women were involved in this case-control study.
Levels of <mark>leptin</mark> and <mark>transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1</mark> in maternal sera were assessed by ELISA.
Serum levels of <mark>interleukin (IL)-1beta</mark>, <mark>IL-1 receptor antagonist</mark> (<mark>IL-1ra</mark>), <mark>IL-2</mark>, <mark>IL-4</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-8</mark>, <mark>IL-10</mark>, <mark>IL-12p40</mark>, <mark>IL-12p70</mark>, <mark>IL-18</mark>, <mark>interferon (IFN)-gamma</mark>, <mark>tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha</mark>, <mark>interferon-gamma-inducible protein (IP)-10</mark>, <mark>monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1</mark>, <mark>intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1</mark> and <mark>vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1</mark> were determined by multiplex suspension array.
Serum <mark>C-reactive protein</mark> (<mark>CRP</mark>) concentrations were measured by an autoanalyzer.
Serum total soluble <mark>fms-like tyrosine kinase-1</mark> (<mark>sFlt-1</mark>) and biologically active <mark>placental growth factor</mark> (<mark>PlGF</mark>) levels were determined by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.
For statistical analyses, non-parametric methods were applied.
RESULTS: There were significant differences in most of the measured laboratory parameters among the three study groups except for serum <mark>IL-1beta</mark> and <mark>TGF-beta1</mark> levels.
Serum <mark>leptin</mark> levels were significantly higher in preeclamptic patients and healthy pregnant women than in healthy non-pregnant women.
Additionally, preeclamptic patients had significantly higher <mark>leptin</mark> levels as compared to healthy pregnant women.
Serum <mark>leptin</mark> levels were independently associated with BMI in healthy non-pregnant women.
In healthy pregnant women, both BMI and serum <mark>CRP</mark> concentrations showed significant positive linear association with <mark>leptin</mark> levels.
There were significant positive correlations between serum <mark>leptin</mark> concentrations of healthy pregnant women and systolic blood pressure, as well as serum levels of <mark>IP-10</mark>, while their serum <mark>leptin</mark> levels correlated inversely with fetal birth weight.
In preeclamptic patients, a significant positive correlation was observed between serum concentrations of <mark>leptin</mark> and <mark>IP-10</mark>.
Furthermore, elevated serum <mark>leptin</mark> level and <mark>sFlt-1</mark>/<mark>PlGF</mark> ratio had an additive (joint) effect in the risk of preeclampsia, as shown by the substantially higher odds ratios of their combination than of either alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous measurement of <mark>leptin</mark> with several inflammatory molecules and angiogenic factors in this study enabled us to investigate their relationship, which can help to understand the role of circulating <mark>leptin</mark> in normal pregnancy and preeclampsia.
<mark>Nemo-like kinase</mark> inhibits osteoblastogenesis by suppressing <mark>bone morphogenetic protein</mark> and <mark>WNT</mark> canonical signaling.
The <mark>bone morphogenetic protein</mark>/<mark>Signaling mothers against decapentaplegic</mark> (<mark>BMP</mark>/<mark>Smad</mark>) and the <mark>WNT</mark> signaling pathways regulate the commitment of mesenchymal cells to the osteoblastic lineage.
<mark>Nemo-like kinase</mark> (<mark>Nlk</mark>) is an evolutionary conserved kinase that suppresses <mark>Smad</mark> transactivation and <mark>WNT</mark> canonical signaling.
However, it is not clear whether these effects of <mark>Nlk</mark> have any consequence on the differentiation of mammalian cells.
To study the function of <mark>Nlk</mark> during the commitment of ST-2 bone marrow stromal cells to the osteoblastic fate, <mark>Nlk</mark> was downregulated by RNA interference (RNAi), following transfection of a specific small interfering (si)RNA.
<mark>Nlk</mark> downregulation increased <mark>alkaline phosphatase</mark> and <mark>osteocalcin</mark> expression and sensitized ST-2 cells to the effects of <mark>BMP2</mark> and <mark>WNT3</mark> on <mark>alkaline phosphatase</mark> mRNA expression and activity.
Accordingly, <mark>Nlk</mark> downregulation enhanced the effect of <mark>BMP2</mark> on the transactivation of the <mark>BMP</mark>/<mark>Smad</mark> reporter construct 12xSBE-Oc-pGL3, and on the levels of phosphorylated <mark>Smad1/5/8</mark>, whereas it did not affect the transactivation of the <mark>transforming growth factor-β</mark>/<mark>Smad</mark> reporter pSBE-Luc.
<mark>Nlk</mark> downregulation sensitized ST-2 cells to the effects of <mark>WNT3</mark> on the transactivation of the <mark>WNT</mark>/T-cell factor (Tcf) reporter construct 16xTCF-Luc, whereas it did not affect cytosolic <mark>β-catenin</mark> levels.
To understand the function of <mark>Nlk</mark> in cells committed to the osteoblastic lineage, <mark>Nlk</mark> was suppressed by RNAi in primary calvarial osteoblasts.
Downregulation of <mark>Nlk</mark> increased <mark>alkaline phosphatase</mark> and <mark>osteocalcin</mark> transcripts and sensitized osteoblasts to the effects of <mark>BMP2</mark> on <mark>alkaline phosphatase</mark> activity and <mark>Smad1/5/8</mark> transactivation and phosphorylation.
In conclusion, <mark>Nlk</mark> suppresses osteoblastogenesis by opposing <mark>BMP</mark>/<mark>Smad</mark> and <mark>WNT</mark> canonical signaling.
Release of <mark>Ku</mark> and <mark>MRN</mark> from DNA ends by <mark>Mre11</mark> nuclease activity and <mark>Ctp1</mark> is required for homologous recombination repair of double-strand breaks.
The multifunctional <mark>Mre11</mark>-<mark>Rad50</mark>-<mark>Nbs1</mark> (<mark>MRN</mark>) protein complex recruits <mark>ATM/Tel1 checkpoint kinase</mark> and <mark>CtIP/Ctp1</mark> homologous recombination (HR) repair factor to double-strand breaks (DSBs).
HR repair commences with the 5'-to-3' resection of DNA ends, generating 3' single-strand DNA (ssDNA) overhangs that bind <mark>Replication Protein A (RPA) complex</mark>, followed by <mark>Rad51 recombinase</mark>.
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the <mark>Mre11</mark>-<mark>Rad50</mark>-<mark>Xrs2</mark> (<mark>MRX</mark>) complex is critical for DSB resection, although the enigmatic <mark>ssDNA endonuclease</mark> activity of <mark>Mre11</mark> and the DNA-end processing factor <mark>Sae2</mark> (<mark>CtIP/Ctp1</mark> ortholog) are largely unnecessary unless the resection activities of <mark>Exo1</mark> and <mark>Sgs1</mark>-<mark>Dna2</mark> are also eliminated.
<mark>Mre11</mark> nuclease activity and <mark>Ctp1/CtIP</mark> are essential for DSB repair in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and mammals.
To investigate DNA end resection in Schizo. pombe, we adapted an assay that directly measures ssDNA formation at a defined DSB.
We found that <mark>Mre11</mark> and <mark>Ctp1</mark> are essential for the efficient initiation of resection, consistent with their equally crucial roles in DSB repair.
<mark>Exo1</mark> is largely responsible for extended resection up to 3.1 kb from a DSB, with an activity dependent on <mark>Rqh1 (Sgs1) DNA helicase</mark> having a minor role.
Despite its critical function in DSB repair, <mark>Mre11</mark> nuclease activity is not required for resection in fission yeast.
However, <mark>Mre11</mark> nuclease and <mark>Ctp1</mark> are required to disassociate the <mark>MRN complex</mark> and the <mark>Ku70</mark>-<mark>Ku80</mark> nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) complex from DSBs, which is required for efficient <mark>RPA</mark> localization.
Eliminating <mark>Ku</mark> makes <mark>Mre11</mark> nuclease activity dispensable for <mark>MRN</mark> disassociation and <mark>RPA</mark> localization, while improving repair of a one-ended DSB formed by replication fork collapse.
From these data we propose that release of the <mark>MRN complex</mark> and <mark>Ku</mark> from DNA ends by <mark>Mre11</mark> nuclease activity and <mark>Ctp1</mark> is a critical step required to expose ssDNA for <mark>RPA</mark> localization and ensuing HR repair.
Blockade of <mark>Notch ligand δ1</mark> promotes allograft survival by inhibiting alloreactive Th1 cells and cytotoxic T cell generation.
The Notch signaling pathway has been recently shown to contribute to T cell differentiation in vitro.
However, the in vivo function of Notch signaling in transplantation remains unknown.
In this study, we investigated the importance of <mark>Delta1</mark> in regulating the alloimmune response in vivo.
<mark>Delta1</mark> expression was upregulated on dendritic cells and monocytes/macrophages upon transplantation in a BALB/c into B6 vascularized cardiac transplant model.
Whereas administration of anti-<mark>Delta1</mark> mAb only slightly delayed survival of cardiac allografts in this fully MHC-mismatched model, it significantly prolonged graft survival in combination with single-dose <mark>CTLA4</mark>-Ig or in <mark>CD28</mark> knockout recipients.
The prolongation of allograft survival was associated with Th2 polarization and a decrease in Th1 and <mark>granzyme B</mark>-producing cytotoxic T cells.
The survival benefit of <mark>Delta1</mark> blockade was abrogated after <mark>IL-4</mark> neutralization and in <mark>STAT6</mark>KO recipients, but was maintained in <mark>STAT4</mark>KO recipients, reinforcing the key role of Th2 cell development in its graft-prolonging effects.
To our knowledge, these data demonstrate for the first time an important role of <mark>Delta1</mark> in alloimmunity, identifying <mark>Delta1</mark> ligand as a potential novel target for immunomodulation in transplantation.
Acute myeloid leukemia of donor origin after allogeneic stem cell transplantation from a sibling who harbors germline <mark>XPD</mark> and <mark>XRCC3</mark> homozygous polymorphisms.
A 54-year-old woman was diagnosed with infiltrative ductal breast carcinoma.
Two years after treatment, the patient developed an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) which harbored del(11q23) in 8% of the blast cells.
The patient was submitted for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (aSCT) from her HLA-compatible sister.
Ten months after transplantation, she relapsed with an AML with basophilic maturation characterized by <mark>CD45</mark>(low) <mark>CD33</mark>(high), <mark>CD117</mark>⁺, <mark>CD13</mark>(-/+), <mark>HLA Dr</mark>(high), <mark>CD123</mark>(high), and <mark>CD203c</mark>⁺ blast cells lacking expression of <mark>CD7</mark>, <mark>CD10</mark>, <mark>CD34</mark>, <mark>CD15</mark>, <mark>CD14</mark>, <mark>CD56</mark>, <mark>CD36</mark>, <mark>CD64</mark>, and cytoplasmic tryptase.
Karyotype analysis showed the emergence of a new clone with t(2;14) and FISH analysis indicated the presence of <mark>MLL</mark> gene rearrangement consistent with del(11q23).
Interestingly, AML blast cell DNA tested with microsatellite markers showed the same pattern as the donor's, suggesting that this AML emerged from donor cells.
Additionally, polymorphisms of the <mark>XPA</mark>, <mark>XPD</mark>, <mark>XRCC1</mark>, <mark>XRCC3</mark> and <mark>RAD51</mark> DNA repair genes revealed three unfavorable alleles with low DNA repair capacity.
In summary, we report the first case of AML involving <mark>XPD</mark> and <mark>XRCC3</mark> polymorphisms from donor origin following allogeneic stem cell transplantation and highlight the potential need for careful analysis of DNA repair gene polymorphisms in selecting candidate donors prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
<mark>Ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing protein 4</mark> (<mark>Asb-4</mark>) colocalizes with <mark>insulin receptor substrate 4</mark> (<mark>IRS4</mark>) in the hypothalamic neurons and mediates <mark>IRS4</mark> degradation.
BACKGROUND: The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus regulates food intake.
<mark>Ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing protein 4</mark> (<mark>Asb-4</mark>) is expressed in <mark>neuropeptide Y</mark> and <mark>proopiomelanocortin</mark> (<mark>POMC</mark>) neurons in the arcuate nucleus, target neurons in the regulation of food intake and metabolism by insulin and leptin.
However, the target protein(s) of <mark>Asb-4</mark> in these neurons remains unknown.
<mark>Insulin receptor substrate 4</mark> (<mark>IRS4</mark>) is an adaptor molecule involved in the signal transduction by both <mark>insulin</mark> and <mark>leptin</mark>.
In the present study we examined the colocalization and interaction of <mark>Asb-4</mark> with <mark>IRS4</mark> and the involvement of <mark>Asb-4</mark> in <mark>insulin</mark> signaling.
RESULTS: In situ hybridization showed that the expression pattern of <mark>Asb-4</mark> was consistent with that of <mark>IRS4</mark> in the rat brain.
Double in situ hybridization showed that <mark>IRS4</mark> colocalized with <mark>Asb-4</mark>, and both <mark>Asb-4</mark> and <mark>IRS4</mark> mRNA were expressed in <mark>proopiomelanocortin</mark> (<mark>POMC</mark>) and <mark>neuropeptide Y</mark> (<mark>NPY</mark>) neurons within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.
In HEK293 cells co-transfected with <mark>Myc</mark>-tagged <mark>Asb-4</mark> and Flag-tagged <mark>IRS4</mark>, <mark>Asb-4</mark> co-immunoprecipitated with <mark>IRS4</mark>; In these cells endogenous <mark>IRS4</mark> also co-immunoprecipitated with transfected <mark>Myc</mark>-<mark>Asb-4</mark>; Furthermore, <mark>Asb-4</mark> co-immunoprecipitated with <mark>IRS4</mark> in rat hypothalamic extracts.
In HEK293 cells over expression of <mark>Asb-4</mark> decreased <mark>IRS4</mark> protein levels and deletion of the <mark>SOCS</mark> box abolished this effect.
<mark>Asb-4</mark> increased the ubiquitination of <mark>IRS4</mark>; Deletion of <mark>SOCS</mark> box abolished this effect.
Expression of <mark>Asb-4</mark> decreased both basal and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of <mark>AKT</mark> at Thr308.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrated that <mark>Asb-4</mark> co-localizes and interacts with <mark>IRS4</mark> in hypothalamic neurons.
The interaction of <mark>Asb-4</mark> with <mark>IRS4</mark> in cell lines mediates the degradation of <mark>IRS4</mark> and decreases <mark>insulin</mark> signaling.
Expression of novel <mark>opsins</mark> and intrinsic light responses in the mammalian retinal ganglion cell line RGC-5.
Presence of <mark>OPN5</mark> in the rat retina.
The vertebrate retina is known to contain three classes of photoreceptor cells: cones and rods responsible for vision, and intrinsically photoresponsive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) involved in diverse non-visual functions such as photic entrainment of daily rhythms and pupillary light responses.
In this paper we investigated the potential intrinsic photoresponsiveness of the rat RGC line, RGC-5, by testing for the presence of visual and non-visual <mark>opsins</mark> and assessing expression of the immediate-early gene protein <mark>c-Fos</mark> and changes in intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization in response to brief light pulses.
Cultured RGC-5 cells express a number of photopigment mRNAs such as <mark>retinal G protein coupled receptor</mark> (<mark>RGR</mark>), <mark>encephalopsin</mark>/<mark>panopsin</mark> (<mark>Opn3</mark>), <mark>neuropsin</mark> (<mark>Opn5</mark>) and <mark>cone opsin</mark> (<mark>Opn1mw</mark>) but not <mark>melanopsin</mark> (<mark>Opn4</mark>) or <mark>rhodopsin</mark>.
<mark>Opn5</mark> immunoreactivity was observed in RGC-5 cells and in the inner retina of rat, mainly localized in the ganglion cell layer (GCL).
Furthermore, white light pulses of different intensities and durations elicited changes both in intracellular Ca(2+) levels and in the induction of <mark>c-Fos</mark> protein in RGC-5 cell cultures.
The results demonstrate that RGC-5 cells expressing diverse putative functional photopigments display intrinsic photosensitivity which accounts for the photic induction of <mark>c-Fos</mark> protein and changes in intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization.
The presence of <mark>Opn5</mark> in the GCL of the rat retina suggests the existence of a novel type of photoreceptor cell.
Loss of <mark>myeloid related protein-8/14</mark> exacerbates cardiac allograft rejection.
BACKGROUND: The calcium-binding proteins <mark>myeloid-related protein (MRP)-8</mark> (<mark>S100A8</mark>) and <mark>MRP-14</mark> (<mark>S100A9</mark>) form <mark>MRP-8/14</mark> heterodimers (<mark>S100A8/A9</mark>, <mark>calprotectin</mark>) that regulate myeloid cell function and inflammatory responses and serve as early serum markers for monitoring acute allograft rejection.
Despite functioning as a proinflammatory mediator, the pathophysiological role of <mark>MRP-8/14</mark> complexes in cardiovascular disease is incompletely defined.
This study investigated the role of <mark>MRP-8/14</mark> in cardiac allograft rejection using <mark>MRP-14</mark>(-/-) mice that lack <mark>MRP-8/14</mark> complexes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined parenchymal rejection after <mark>major histocompatibility complex class II</mark> allomismatched cardiac transplantation (bm12 donor heart and B6 recipients) in wild-type (WT) and <mark>MRP-14</mark>(-/-) recipients.
Allograft survival averaged 5.9±2.9 weeks (n=10) in <mark>MRP-14</mark>(-/-) recipients compared with >12 weeks (n=15; P<0.0001) in WT recipients.
Two weeks after transplantation, allografts in <mark>MRP-14</mark>(-/-) recipients had significantly higher parenchymal rejection scores (2.8±0.8; n=8) than did WT recipients (0.8±0.8; n=12; P<0.0001).
Compared with WT recipients, allografts in <mark>MRP-14</mark>(-/-) recipients had significantly increased T-cell and macrophage infiltration and increased mRNA levels of <mark>interfer<mark>nterferon-γ</mark> and <mark>interferon-γ</mark>-associated <mark>chemokines</mark> (<mark>CXCL9</mark>, <mark>CXCL10</mark>, and <mark>CXCL11</mark>), <mark>interleukin-6</mark>, and <mark>interleukin-17</mark> with significantly higher levels of Th17 cells.
<mark>MRP-14</mark>(-/-) recipients also had significantly more lymphocytes in the adjacent para-aortic lymph nodes than did WT recipients (cells per lymph node: 23.7±0.7×10(5) for <mark>MRP-14</mark>(-/-) versus 6.0±0.2×10(5) for WT; P<0.0001).
The dendritic cells (DCs) of the <mark>MRP-14</mark>(-/-) recipients of bm12 hearts expressed significantly higher levels of the costimulatory molecules <mark>CD80</mark> and <mark>CD86</mark> than did those of WT recipients 2 weeks after transplantation.
Mixed leukocyte reactions with allo-endothelial cell-primed <mark>MRP-14</mark>(-/-) DCs resulted in significantly higher antigen-presenting function than reactions using WT DCs.
Ovalbumin-primed <mark>MRP-14</mark>(-/-) DCs augmented proliferation of OT-II (ovalbumin-specific T cell receptor transgenic) <mark>CD4</mark>(+) T cells with increased <mark>interleukin-2</mark> and <mark>interferon-γ</mark> production.
Cardiac allografts of B6 <mark>major histocompatibility complex class II</mark>(-/-) hosts and of B6 WT hosts receiving <mark>MRP-14</mark>(-/-) DCs had significantly augmented inflammatory cell infiltration and accelerated allograft rejection compared with WT DCs from transferred recipient allografts.
Bone marrow-derived <mark>MRP-14</mark>(-/-) DCs infected with <mark>MRP-8</mark> and <mark>MRP-14</mark> retroviral vectors showed significantly decreased <mark>CD80</mark> and <mark>CD86</mark> expression compared with controls, indicating that <mark>MRP-8/14</mark> regulates <mark>B7</mark>-costimulatory molecule expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that <mark>MRP-14</mark> regulates B7 molecule expression and reduces antigen presentation by DCs and subsequent T-cell priming.
The absence of <mark>MRP-14</mark> markedly increased T-cell activation and exacerbated allograft rejection, indicating a previously unrecognized role for <mark>MRP-14</mark> in immune cell biology.
<mark>MUC13</mark> <mark>mucin</mark> augments pancreatic tumorigenesis.
The high death rate of pancreatic cancer is attributed to the lack of reliable methods for early detection and underlying molecular mechanisms of its aggressive pathogenesis.
Although <mark>MUC13</mark>, a newly identified transmembrane <mark>mucin</mark>, is known to be aberrantly expressed in ovarian and gastro-intestinal cancers, its role in pancreatic cancer is unknown.
Herein, we investigated the expression profile and functions of <mark>MUC13</mark> in pancreatic cancer progression.
The expression profile of <mark>MUC13</mark> in pancreatic cancer was investigated using a recently generated monoclonal antibody (clone PPZ0020) and pancreatic tissue microarrays.
The expression of <mark>MUC13</mark> was significantly (P < 0.005) higher in cancer samples compared with normal/nonneoplastic pancreatic tissues.
For functional analyses, full-length <mark>MUC13</mark> was expressed in <mark>MUC13</mark> null pancreatic cancer cell lines, MiaPaca and Panc1.
<mark>MUC13</mark> overexpression caused a significant (P < 0.05) increase in cell motility, invasion, proliferation, and anchorage-dependent or -independent clonogenicity while decreasing cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesion.
Exogenous <mark>MUC13</mark> expression significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced pancreatic tumor growth and reduced animal survival in a xenograft mouse model.
These tumorigenic characteristics correlated with the upregulation/phosphorylation of <mark>HER2</mark>, <mark>p21-activated kinase 1</mark> (<mark>PAK1</mark>), <mark>extracellular signal-regulated kinase</mark> (<mark>ERK</mark>), <mark>Akt</mark>, and <mark>metastasin</mark> (<mark>S100A4</mark>), and the suppression of <mark>p53</mark>.
Conversely, suppression of <mark>MUC13</mark> in HPAFII pancreatic cancer cells by short hairpin RNA resulted in suppression of tumorigenic characteristics, repression of <mark>HER2</mark>, <mark>PAK1</mark>, <mark>ERK</mark>, and <mark>S100A4</mark>, and upregulation of <mark>p53</mark>.
<mark>MUC13</mark> suppression also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced tumor growth and increased animal survival.
These results imply a role of <mark>MUC13</mark> in pancreatic cancer and suggest its potential use as a diagnostic and therapeutic target.
<mark>Interferon regulatory factor 3</mark> plays an anti-inflammatory role in microglia by activating the <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> pathway.
BACKGROUND: Microglia are the principal cells involved in the innate immune response in the CNS.
Activated microglia produce a number of proinflammatory <mark>cytokines</mark> implicated in neurotoxicity but they also are a major source of anti-inflammatory <mark>cytokines</mark>, antiviral proteins and growth factors.
Therefore, an immune therapy aiming at suppressing the proinflammatory phenotype while enhancing the anti-inflammatory, growth promoting phenotype would be of great benefit.
In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that <mark>interferon regulatory factor 3</mark> (<mark>IRF3</mark>), a <mark>transcription factor</mark> required for the induction of <mark>IFNbeta</mark> following <mark>TLR3</mark> or <mark>TLR4</mark> activation, is critical to the microglial phenotype change from proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory, and that this phenotype change can be greatly facilitated by <mark>IRF3</mark> gene transfer.
METHODS: Cultures of primary human fetal microglia were transduced with <mark>IRF3</mark> using recombinant adenovirus (Ad-<mark>IRF3</mark>) and subjected to microarray analysis, real-time PCR, immunoblotting and ELISA to determine inflammatory gene expression.
Two different types of immune stimuli were tested, the TLR ligands, poly IC (PIC) and LPS, and the proinflammatory <mark>cytokines</mark>, <mark>IL-1</mark>/<mark>IFNgamma</mark>.
In addition, the role of the <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> pathway was examined by use of a pharmacological inhibitor, LY294002.
RESULTS: Our results show that Ad-<mark>IRF3</mark> suppressed proinflammatory genes (<mark>IL-1alpha</mark>, <mark>IL-1beta</mark>, <mark>TNFalpha</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-8</mark> and <mark>CXCL1</mark>) and enhanced anti-inflammatory genes (<mark>IL-1 receptor antagonist</mark>, <mark>IL-10</mark> and <mark>IFNbeta</mark>) in microglia, regardless of the cell stimuli applied.
Furthermore, Ad-<mark>IRF3</mark> activated <mark>Akt</mark>, and LY294002 reversed the effects of Ad-<mark>IRF3</mark> on microglial inflammatory gene expression.
p<mark>Akt</mark> was critical in LPS- or PIC-induced production of <mark>IL-10</mark> and <mark>IL-1ra</mark>.
Significantly, microglial <mark>IFNbeta</mark> protein production was also dependent on p<mark>Akt</mark> and required both Ad-<mark>IRF3</mark> and immunological stimuli (PIC &gt; <mark>IL-1</mark>/<mark>IFNgamma</mark>).
p<mark>Akt</mark> played much less prominent and variable roles in microglial proinflammatory gene expression.
This anti-inflammatory promoting role of <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> appeared to be specific to microglia, since astrocyte proinflammatory gene expression (as well as <mark>IFNbeta</mark> expression) required <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark>.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a novel anti-inflammatory role for the <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> signaling pathway in microglia.
They further suggest that <mark>IRF3</mark> gene therapy could facilitate the microglial phenotype switch from proinflammatory ("M1-like") to anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory ("M2-like"), in part, by augmenting the level of p<mark>Akt</mark>.
<mark>TBX21</mark> and <mark>HLX1</mark> polymorphisms influence <mark>cytokine</mark> secretion at birth.
BACKGROUND: <mark>TBX21</mark> (<mark>T cell specific T-box transcription factor</mark>) and <mark>HLX1</mark> (<mark>H.20-like homeobox 1</mark>) are crucial <mark>transcription factors</mark> of T(H)1-cells, inducing their differentiation and suppressing T(H)2 commitment, particularly important for early life immune development.
This study investigated the influence of <mark>TBX21</mark> and <mark>HLX1</mark> single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which have previously been shown to be associated with asthma, on T(H)1/T(H)2 lineage <mark>cytokines</mark> at birth.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) of 200 neonates were genotyped for two <mark>TBX21</mark> and three <mark>HLX1</mark> SNPs.
CBMCs were stimulated with innate (Lipid A, LpA; Peptidoglycan, Ppg), adaptive stimuli (house dust mite <mark>Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus 1</mark>, <mark>Derp1</mark>) or mitogen (phytohemagglutinin, PHA).
<mark>Cytokines</mark>, T-cells and mRNA expression of T(H)1/T(H)2-related genes were assessed.
Atopic diseases during the first 3 years of life were assessed by questionnaire answered by the parents.
Carriers of <mark>TBX21</mark> promoter SNP rs17250932 and <mark>HLX1</mark> promoter SNP rs2738751 showed reduced or trendwise reduced (p≤0.07) <mark>IL-5</mark>, <mark>IL-13</mark> and <mark>TNF-α</mark> secretion after LpA-stimulation.
Carriers of <mark>HLX1</mark> SNP rs2738751 had lower <mark>IL-13</mark> levels following Ppg-stimulation (p = 0.08).
Carriers of <mark>HLX1</mark> exon 1 SNP rs12141189 showed increased <mark>IL-5</mark> (LpA, p = 0.007; Ppg, p = 0.10), trendwise increased <mark>IL-13</mark> (LpA), higher <mark>GM-CSF</mark> (LpA/Ppg, p≤0.05) and trendwise decreased <mark>IFN-γ</mark> secretion (<mark>Derp1</mark>+LpA-stimulation, p = 0.1).
Homozygous carriers of <mark>HLX1</mark> promoter SNP rs3806325 showed increased <mark>IL-13</mark> and <mark>IL-6</mark> (unstimulated, p≤0.03).
In carriers of <mark>TBX21</mark> intron 3 SNP rs11079788 no differences in <mark>cytokine</mark> secretion were observed.
mRNA expression of T(H)1/T(H)2-related genes partly correlated with <mark>cytokines</mark> at protein level.
<mark>TBX21</mark> SNP rs11079788 carriers developed less symptoms of atopic dermatitis at 3 years of age (p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms in <mark>TBX21</mark> and <mark>HLX1</mark> influenced primarily <mark>IL-5</mark> and <mark>IL-13</mark> secretion after LpA-stimulation in cord blood suggesting that genetic variations in the <mark>transcription factors</mark> essential for the T(H)1-pathway may contribute to modified T(H)2-immune responses already early in life.
Further follow-up of the cohort is required to study the polymorphisms' relevance for immune-mediated diseases such as childhood asthma.
Reciprocal effects of NNK and <mark>SLURP-1</mark> on oncogene expression in target epithelial cells.
AIMS: To elucidate how the <mark>nicotinic acetylcholine receptors</mark> expressed on bronchial and oral epithelial cells targeted by the tobacco nitrosamine (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone) (NNK) facilitate carcinogenic transformation.
MAIN METHODS: Since NNK-dependent transformation can be abolished by the nicotinergic secreted mammalian <mark>Ly-6/urokinase plasminogen activator receptor related protein-1</mark> (<mark>SLURP-1</mark>), we compared effects of NNK and recombinant (r)<mark>SLURP-1</mark> on the expression of genes related to tumorigenesis in human immortalized bronchial and oral epithelial cell lines BEP2D and Het-1A, respectively.
KEY FINDINGS: NNK stimulated expression of oncogenic genes, including <mark>MYB</mark> and <mark>PIK3CA</mark> in BEP2D, <mark>ETS1</mark>, <mark>NRAS</mark> and <mark>SRC</mark> in Het-1A, and <mark>AKT1</mark>, <mark>KIT</mark> and <mark>RB1</mark> in both cell types, which could be abolished in the presence of r<mark>SLURP-1</mark>.
Other cancer-related genes whose upregulation by NNK was abolishable by r<mark>SLURP-1</mark> were the <mark>growth factors</mark> <mark>EGF</mark> in BEP2D cells and <mark>HGF</mark> in Het-1A cells, and the <mark>transcription factors</mark> <mark>CDKN2A</mark> and <mark>STAT3</mark> (Het-1A only).
NNK also upregulated the anti-apoptotic <mark>BCL2</mark> (Het-1A) and downregulated the pro-apoptotic <mark>TNF</mark> (Het-1A), <mark>BAX</mark> and <mark>CASP8</mark> (BEP2D), all of which could be abolished, in part, by r<mark>SLURP-1</mark>.
NNK decreased expression of the <mark>CTNNB1</mark> gene encoding the intercellular adhesion molecule <mark>beta-catenin</mark> (BEP2D), as well as tumor suppressors <mark>CDKN3</mark> and <mark>FOXD3</mark> in BEP2D cells and <mark>SERPINB5</mark> in Het-1A cells.
These pro-oncogenic effects of NNK were abolished by r<mark>SLURP-1</mark> that also upregulated <mark>RUNX3</mark>.
SIGNIFICANCE: The obtained results identified target genes for both NNK and <mark>SLURP-1</mark> and shed light on the molecular mechanism of their reciprocal effects on tumorigenic transformation of bronchial and oral epithelial cells.
<mark>IL-10</mark> deficiency blocks the ability of LPS to regulate expression of tolerance-related molecules on dendritic cells.
<mark>Interleukin-10</mark> (<mark>IL-10</mark>) is an anti-inflammatory <mark>cytokine</mark> that plays an important role in regulating the local inflammatory immune response, but regulatory mechanisms of this <mark>cytokine</mark> have not been fully elucidated.
Here, we demonstrate that <mark>IL-10</mark> deficiency renders LPS treatment ineffective in regulating the expression of <mark>CD40</mark>, <mark>CD80</mark>, <mark>CD86</mark>, <mark>B7-H2</mark>, and <mark>B7-DC</mark> on dendritic cells (DCs) and blocks upregulation of <mark>IL-27</mark>.
This inability to respond to LPS was found in both <mark>IL-10</mark>(-/-) bone marrow derived and splenic DCs.
Compared with wild-type DCs, <mark>IL-10</mark>(-/-) DCs expressed similar levels of <mark>TLR4</mark> and <mark>CD14</mark>, but produced less <mark>LPS-binding protein</mark>.
The deficiency in <mark>LPS-binding protein</mark> production may explain the failure of <mark>IL-10</mark>(-/-) DCs to respond normally to LPS.
Moreover, lack of <mark>IL-10</mark> modulated the proportions of <mark>CD11c</mark>(+) <mark>CD8</mark>(+) and <mark>CD11c</mark>(+) <mark>B220</mark>(+) DCs, which play an important role in local inflammatory responses and tolerance.
<mark>IL-10</mark> deficiency also blocked expression of <mark>galectin-1</mark>, <mark>CD205</mark>, and <mark>CD103</mark>, which are necessary for central and peripheral tolerance.
While they did not respond to LPS, <mark>IL-10</mark>(-/-) DCs produced increased levels of <mark>IL-6</mark> and <mark>CCL4</mark> after TNF-α treatment.
Together, our results demonstrate that <mark>IL-10</mark> deficiency affects the immune functions of DCs, which may contribute to the increased severity of autoimmune diseases seen in <mark>IL-10</mark>(-/-) mice.
<mark>TNFR-associated factor 2</mark> deficiency in B lymphocytes predisposes to chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma in mice.
We have previously shown that transgenic (tg) mice expressing in B lymphocytes both <mark>BCL-2</mark> and a <mark>TNFR-associated factor 2</mark> (<mark>TRAF2</mark>) mutant lacking the really interesting new gene and zinc finger domains (<mark>TRAF2</mark>DN) develop small lymphocytic lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia with high incidence (Zapata et al. 2004.
Proc.
Nat.
Acad. Sci. USA 101: 16600-16605).
Further analysis of the expression of <mark>TRAF2</mark> and <mark>TRAF2</mark>DN in purified B cells demonstrated that expression of both endogenous <mark>TRAF2</mark> and tg <mark>TRAF2</mark>DN was negligible in <mark>Traf2</mark>DN-tg B cells compared with wild-type mice.
This was the result of <mark>proteasome</mark>-dependent degradation, and rendered <mark>TRAF2</mark>DN B cells as bona fide <mark>TRAF2</mark>-deficient B cells.
Similar to B cells with targeted <mark>Traf2</mark> deletion, <mark>Traf2</mark>DN-tg mice show expanded marginal zone B cell population and have constitutive <mark>p100 NF-kappaB2</mark> processing.
Also, <mark>TRAF3</mark>, <mark>X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis</mark>, and <mark>Bcl-X(L)</mark> expression levels were increased, whereas <mark>cellular inhibitors of apoptosis 1 and 2</mark> levels were drastically reduced compared with those found in wild-type B cells.
Moreover, consistent with previous results, we also show that <mark>TRAF2</mark> was required for efficient <mark>JNK</mark> and <mark>ERK</mark> activation in response to <mark>CD40</mark> engagement.
However, <mark>TRAF2</mark> was deleterious for <mark>BCR</mark>-mediated activation of these <mark>kinases</mark>.
In contrast, <mark>TRAF2</mark> deficiency had no effect on <mark>CD40</mark>-mediated <mark>p38 MAPK</mark> activation but significantly reduced <mark>BCR</mark>-mediated <mark>p38</mark> activation.
Finally, we further confirm that <mark>TRAF2</mark> was required for <mark>CD40</mark>-mediated proliferation, but its absence relieved B cells of the need for <mark>B cell activating factor</mark> for survival.
Altogether, our results suggest that <mark>TRAF2</mark> deficiency cooperates with <mark>BCL-2</mark> in promoting chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma in mice, possibly by specifically enforcing marginal zone B cell accumulation, increasing <mark>X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis</mark> expression, and rendering B cells independent of <mark>B cell activating factor</mark> for survival.
Contribution of <mark>STAT4</mark> gene single-nucleotide polymorphism to systemic lupus erythematosus in the Polish population.
The <mark>STAT4</mark> has been found to be a susceptible gene in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in various populations.
There are evident population differences in the context of clinical manifestations of SLE, therefore we investigated the prevalence of the <mark>STAT4</mark> G > C (rs7582694) polymorphism in patients with SLE (n = 253) and controls (n = 521) in a sample of the Polish population.
We found that patients with the <mark>STAT4</mark> C/G and CC genotypes exhibited a 1.583-fold increased risk of SLE incidence (95 % CI = 1.168-2.145, p = 0.003), with OR for the C/C versus C/G and G/G genotypes was 1.967 (95 % CI = 1.152-3.358, p = 0.0119).
The OR for the <mark>STAT4</mark> C allele frequency showed a 1.539-fold increased risk of SLE (95 % CI = 1.209-1.959, p = 0.0004).
We also observed an increased frequency of <mark>STAT4</mark> C/C and C/G genotypes in SLE patients with renal symptoms OR = 2.259 (1.365-3.738, p = 0.0014), (p (corr) = 0.0238) and in SLE patients with neurologic manifestations OR = 2.867 (1.467-5.604, p = 0.0016), (p (corr) = 0.0272).
Moreover, we found a contribution of <mark>STAT4</mark> C/C and C/G genotypes to the presence of the anti-<mark>snRNP</mark> Ab OR = 3.237 (1.667-6.288, p = 0.0003), (p (corr) = 0.0051) and the presence of the anti-<mark>Scl-70</mark> Ab OR = 2.665 (1.380-5.147, p = 0.0028), (p (corr) = 0.0476).
Our studies confirmed an association of the <mark>STAT4</mark> C (rs7582694) variant with the development of SLE and occurrence of some clinical manifestations of the disease.
Defining an <mark>EPOR</mark>- regulated transcriptome for primary progenitors, including <mark>Tnfr-sf13c</mark> as a novel mediator of <mark>EPO</mark>- dependent erythroblast formation.
Certain concepts concerning <mark>EPO</mark>/<mark>EPOR</mark> action modes have been challenged by in vivo studies: <mark>Bcl-x</mark> levels are elevated in maturing erythroblasts, but not in their progenitors; truncated <mark>EPOR</mark> alleles that lack a major <mark>p85/PI3K</mark> recruitment site nonetheless promote polycythemia; and <mark>Erk1</mark> disruption unexpectedly bolsters erythropoiesis.
To discover novel <mark>EPO</mark>/<mark>EPOR</mark> action routes, global transcriptome analyses presently are applied to interrogate <mark>EPO</mark>/<mark>EPOR</mark> effects on primary bone marrow-derived CFUe-like progenitors.
Overall, 160 <mark>EPO</mark>/<mark>EPOR</mark> target transcripts were significantly modulated 2-to 21.8-fold.
A unique set of <mark>EPO</mark>-regulated survival factors included <mark>Lyl1</mark>, <mark>Gas5</mark>, <mark>Pim3</mark>, <mark>Pim1</mark>, <mark>Bim</mark>, <mark>Trib3</mark> and <mark>Serpina 3g</mark>.
<mark>EPO</mark>/<mark>EPOR</mark>-modulated cell cycle mediators included <mark>Cdc25a</mark>, <mark>Btg3</mark>, <mark>Cyclin-d2</mark>, <mark>p27-kip1</mark>, <mark>Cyclin-g2</mark> and <mark>CyclinB1-IP-1</mark>.
<mark>EPO</mark> regulation of signal transduction factors was also interestingly complex.
For example, not only <mark>Socs3</mark> plus <mark>Socs2</mark> but also <mark>Spred2</mark>, <mark>Spred1</mark> and <mark>Eaf1</mark> were <mark>EPO</mark>-induced as negative-feedback components.
<mark>Socs2</mark>, plus five additional targets, further proved to comprise new <mark>EPOR</mark>/<mark>Jak2</mark>/<mark>Stat5</mark> response genes (which are important for erythropoiesis during anemia).
Among receptors, an atypical <mark>TNF-receptor</mark> <mark>Tnfr-sf13c</mark> was up-modulated &gt;5-fold by <mark>EPO</mark>.
Functionally, <mark>Tnfr-sf13c</mark> ligation proved to both promote proerythroblast survival, and substantially enhance erythroblast formation.
The <mark>EPOR</mark> therefore engages a sophisticated set of transcriptome response circuits, with <mark>Tnfr-sf13c</mark> deployed as one novel positive regulator of proerythroblast formation.
Variation in <mark>IL10</mark> and other genes involved in the immune response and in oxidation and prostate cancer recurrence.
BACKGROUND: To evaluate the association of variation in genes involved in immune response, including <mark>IL10</mark>, production and detoxification of reactive oxygen species, and repair of oxidative DNA damage with risk of recurrence after surgery for localized prostate cancer.
METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study of men who had a radical prostatectomy in 1993 to 2001.
A total of 484 recurrence cases and 484 controls were matched on age, race, and pathologic stage and grade.
Germline DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded unaffected lymph nodes.
We genotyped candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in <mark>IL10</mark>, <mark>CRP</mark>, <mark>GPX1</mark>, <mark>GSR</mark>, <mark>GSTP1</mark>, <mark>hOGG1</mark>, <mark>IL1B</mark>, <mark>IL1RN</mark>, <mark>IL6</mark>, <mark>IL8</mark>, <mark>MPO</mark>, <mark>NOS2</mark>, <mark>NOS3</mark>, <mark>SOD1</mark>, <mark>SOD2</mark>, <mark>SOD3</mark>, <mark>TLR4</mark>, and <mark>TNF</mark> and tagging SNPs in <mark>IL10</mark>, <mark>CRP</mark>, <mark>GSR</mark>, <mark>IL1RN</mark>, <mark>IL6</mark>, <mark>NOS2</mark>, and <mark>NOS3</mark>.
We used conditional logistic regression to estimate OR and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: The minor allele (A) in <mark>IL10</mark> rs1800872, known to produce less <mark>interleukin-10</mark> (<mark>IL-10</mark>), was associated with a higher risk of recurrence (OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.00-3.10), and the minor allele (G) in rs1800896, known to produce more <mark>IL-10</mark>, was associated with a lower risk of recurrence (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48-0.91).
We also observed associations for candidate SNPs in <mark>CRP</mark>, <mark>GSTP1</mark>, and <mark>IL1B</mark>.
A common <mark>IL10</mark> haplotype and 2 common <mark>NOS2</mark> haplotypes were associated with recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Variation in <mark>IL10</mark>, <mark>CRP</mark>, <mark>GSTP1</mark>, <mark>IL1B</mark>, and <mark>NOS2</mark> was associated with prostate cancer recurrence independent of pathologic prognostic factors.
IMPACT: This study supports that genetic variation in immune response and oxidation influence prostate cancer recurrence risk and suggests genetic variation in these pathways may inform prognosis.
<mark>Minibrain</mark>/<mark>Dyrk1a</mark> regulates food intake through the <mark>Sir2</mark>-<mark>FOXO</mark>-<mark>sNPF</mark>/<mark>NPY</mark> pathway in Drosophila and mammals.
Feeding behavior is one of the most essential activities in animals, which is tightly regulated by neuroendocrine factors.
Drosophila melanogaster <mark>short neuropeptide F</mark> (<mark>sNPF</mark>) and the mammalian functional homolog <mark>neuropeptide Y</mark> (<mark>NPY</mark>) regulate food intake.
Understanding the molecular mechanism of <mark>sNPF</mark> and <mark>NPY</mark> signaling is critical to elucidate feeding regulation.
Here, we found that <mark>minibrain</mark> (<mark>mnb</mark>) and the mammalian ortholog <mark>Dyrk1a</mark>, target genes of <mark>sNPF</mark> and <mark>NPY</mark> signaling, [corrected] regulate food intake in Drosophila melanogaster and mice.
In Drosophila melanogaster neuronal cells and mouse hypothalamic cells, <mark>sNPF</mark> and <mark>NPY</mark> modulated the <mark>mnb</mark> and <mark>Dyrk1a</mark> expression through the <mark>PKA</mark>-<mark>CREB</mark> pathway.
Increased <mark>Dyrk1a</mark> activated <mark>Sirt1</mark> to regulate the deacetylation of <mark>FOXO</mark>, which potentiated <mark>FOXO</mark>-induced <mark>sNPF</mark>/<mark>NPY</mark> expression and in turn promoted food intake.
Conversely, <mark>AKT</mark>-mediated insulin signaling suppressed <mark>FOXO</mark>-mediated <mark>sNPF</mark>/<mark>NPY</mark> expression, which resulted in decreasing food intake.
Furthermore, human <mark>Dyrk1a</mark> transgenic mice exhibited decreased <mark>FOXO</mark> acetylation and increased <mark>NPY</mark> expression in the hypothalamus, and [corrected] increased food intake.
Our findings demonstrate that <mark>Mnb</mark>/<mark>Dyrk1a</mark> regulates food intake through the evolutionary conserved <mark>Sir2</mark>-<mark>FOXO</mark>-<mark>sNPF</mark>/<mark>NPY</mark> pathway in Drosophila melanogaster and mammals.
<mark>SOCS3</mark> deficiency promotes M1 macrophage polarization and inflammation.
Macrophages participate in both the amplification of inflammation at the time of injury and downregulation of the inflammatory response to avoid excess tissue damage.
These divergent functions of macrophages are dictated by their microenvironment, especially <mark>cytokines</mark>, which promote a spectrum of macrophage phenotypes.
The M1 proinflammatory phenotype is induced by LPS, <mark>IFN-gamma</mark>, and <mark>GM-CSF</mark>, and <mark>IL-4</mark>, <mark>IL-13</mark>, and <mark>M-CSF</mark> induce anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages.
<mark>Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins</mark> function as feedback inhibitors of the <mark>JAK</mark>/<mark>STAT</mark> signaling pathway, and they can terminate innate and adaptive immune responses.
In this study, we have evaluated the influence of <mark>SOCS3</mark> on macrophage polarization and function.
Macrophages obtained from LysMCre-<mark>SOCS3</mark>(fl/fl) mice, which lack <mark>SOCS3</mark> in myeloid lineage cells, exhibit enhanced and prolonged activation of the <mark>JAK</mark>/<mark>STAT</mark> pathway compared with macrophages from <mark>SOCS3</mark>(fl/fl) mice.
Furthermore, <mark>SOCS3</mark>-deficient macrophages have higher levels of the <mark>M1 genes</mark> <mark>IL-1beta</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-12</mark>, <mark>IL-23</mark>, and <mark>inducible NO synthase</mark> owing to enhanced transcriptional activation and chromatin modifications.
<mark>SOCS3</mark>-deficient M1 macrophages also have a stronger capacity to induce Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation than M1 macrophages from <mark>SOCS3</mark>(fl/fl) mice.
Lastly, LPS-induced sepsis is exacerbated in LysMCre-<mark>SOCS3</mark>(fl/fl) mice and is associated with enhanced <mark>STAT1/3</mark> activation and increased plasma levels of M1 <mark>cytokines</mark>/<mark>chemokines</mark> such as <mark>IL-1beta</mark>, <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>CCL3</mark>, <mark>CCL4</mark>, and <mark>CXCL11</mark>.
These findings collectively indicate that <mark>SOCS3</mark> is involved in repressing the M1 proinflammatory phenotype, thereby deactivating inflammatory responses in macrophages.
EGCG inhibits growth of human pancreatic tumors orthotopically implanted in Balb C nude mice through modulation of <mark>FKHRL1</mark>/<mark>FOXO3a</mark> and <mark>neuropilin</mark>.
Human pancreatic cancer is currently one of the fourth leading causes of cancer-related mortality with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5 %.
Since pancreatic carcinoma is largely refractory to conventional therapies, there is a strong medical need for the development of novel and innovative cancer preventive strategies.
The <mark>forkhead transcription factors of the O class</mark> (<mark>FOXO</mark>) play a major role in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and tumorigenesis.
The objectives of this study were to examine whether <mark>FKHRL1</mark>/<mark>FOXO3a</mark> modulates antitumor activity of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), an active ingredient in green tea, in pancreatic cancer model in vivo.
PANC-1 cells were orthotopically implanted into Balb c nude mice and gavaged with EGCG after tumor formation.
Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by <mark>Ki67</mark> and TUNEL staining, respectively.
The expression of <mark>PI3K</mark>, <mark>AKT</mark>, <mark>ERK</mark>, and <mark>FOXO3a</mark>/<mark>FKHRL1</mark> and its target genes were measured by the western blot analysis and/or q-RT-PCR.
<mark>FOXO</mark>-DNA binding was measured by gel shift assay.
EGCG-treated mice showed significant inhibition in tumor growth which was associated with reduced phosphorylation of <mark>ERK</mark>, <mark>PI3K</mark>, <mark>AKT</mark>, and <mark>FKHRL1</mark>/<mark>FOXO3a</mark>, and modulation of <mark>FOXO</mark> target genes.
EGCG induced apoptosis by upregulating <mark>Bim</mark> and activating <mark>caspase-3</mark>.
EGCG modulated markers of cell cycle (<mark>p27</mark>/<mark>KIP1</mark>), angiogenesis (<mark>CD31</mark>, <mark>VEGF</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-8</mark>, <mark>SEMA3F</mark>, and <mark>HIF1α</mark>), and metastasis (<mark>MMP2</mark> and <mark>MMP7</mark>).
The inhibition of <mark>VEGF</mark> by EGCG was associated with suppression of <mark>neuropilin</mark>.
EGCG inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition by upregulating the expression of <mark>E-cadherin</mark> and inhibiting the expression of <mark>N-cadherin</mark> and <mark>Zeb1</mark>.
These data suggest that EGCG inhibits pancreatic cancer orthotopic tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis which are associated with inhibition of <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>AKT</mark> and <mark>ERK</mark> pathways and activation of <mark>FKHRL1</mark>/<mark>FOXO3a</mark>.
As a conclusion, EGCG can be used for the prevention and/or treatment of pancreatic cancer.
<mark>Nrf2</mark> is controlled by two distinct <mark>beta-TrCP</mark> recognition motifs in its <mark>Neh6</mark> domain, one of which can be modulated by <mark>GSK-3</mark> activity.
Identification of regulatable mechanisms by which transcription factor <mark>NF-E2 p45-related factor 2</mark> (<mark>Nrf2</mark>) is repressed will allow strategies to be designed that counter drug resistance associated with its upregulation in tumours that harbour somatic mutations in <mark>Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1</mark> (<mark>Keap1</mark>), a gene that encodes a joint adaptor and substrate receptor for the <mark>Cul3</mark>-<mark>Rbx1</mark>/<mark>Roc1</mark> <mark>ubiquitin ligase</mark>.
We now show that mouse <mark>Nrf2</mark> contains two binding sites for <mark>beta-transducin repeat-containing protein</mark> (<mark>beta-TrCP</mark>), which acts as a substrate receptor for the <mark>Skp1</mark>-<mark>Cul1</mark>-<mark>Rbx1</mark>/<mark>Roc1</mark> <mark>ubiquitin ligase complex</mark>.
Deletion of either binding site in <mark>Nrf2</mark> decreased <mark>beta-TrCP</mark>-mediated ubiquitylation of the transcription factor.
The ability of one of the two <mark>beta-TrCP</mark>-binding sites to serve as a degron could be both increased and decreased by manipulation of <mark>glycogen synthase kinase-3</mark> (<mark>GSK-3</mark>) activity.
Biotinylated-peptide pull-down assays identified DSGIS(338) and DSAPGS(378) as the two <mark>beta-TrCP</mark>-binding motifs in <mark>Nrf2</mark>.
Significantly, our pull-down assays indicated that <mark>beta-TrCP</mark> binds a phosphorylated version of DSGIS more tightly than its non-phosphorylated counterpart, whereas this was not the case for DSAPGS.
These data suggest that DSGIS, but not DSAPGS, contains a functional <mark>GSK-3</mark> phosphorylation site.
Activation of <mark>GSK-3</mark> in <mark>Keap1</mark>-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), or in human lung A549 cells that contain mutant <mark>Keap1</mark>, by inhibition of the <mark>phosphoinositide 3-kinase</mark> (<mark>PI3K</mark>)-<mark>protein kinase B</mark> (<mark>PKB</mark>)/<mark>Akt</mark> pathway markedly reduced endogenous <mark>Nrf2</mark> protein and decreased to 10-50% of normal the levels of mRNA for prototypic <mark>Nrf2</mark>-regulated enzymes, including the glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic and modifier subunits, <mark>glutathione S-transferases Alpha-1 and Mu-1</mark>, <mark>haem oxygenase-1</mark> and <mark>NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1</mark>.
Pre-treatment of <mark>Keap1</mark>(-/-) MEFs or A549 cells with the LY294002 <mark>PI3K</mark> inhibitor or the MK-2206 <mark>PKB</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> inhibitor increased their sensitivity to acrolein, chlorambucil and cisplatin between 1.9-fold and 3.1-fold, and this was substantially attenuated by simultaneous pre-treatment with the <mark>GSK-3</mark> inhibitor CT99021.
<mark>N-Myc</mark> and <mark>L-Myc</mark> are essential for hair cell formation but not maintenance.
Sensorineural hearing loss results from damage to the hair cells of the organ of Corti and is irreversible in mammals.
While hair cell regeneration may prove to be the ideal therapy after hearing loss, prevention of initial hair cell loss could provide even more benefit at a lower cost.
Previous studies have shown that the deletion of <mark>Atoh1</mark> results in embryonic loss of hair cells while the absence of <mark>Barhl1</mark>, <mark>Gfi1</mark>, and <mark>Pou4f3</mark> leads to the progressive loss of hair cells in newborn mice.
We recently reported that in the early embryonic absence of <mark>N-Myc</mark> (using <mark>Pax2</mark>-Cre), hair cells in the organ of Corti develop and remain until at least seven days after birth, with subsequent progressive loss.
Thus, <mark>N-Myc</mark> plays a role in hair cell viability; however, it is unclear if this is due to its early expression in hair cell precursors and throughout the growing otocyst as it functions through proliferation or its late expression exclusively in differentiated hair cells.
Furthermore, the related family member <mark>L-Myc</mark> is mostly co-expressed in the ear, including in differentiated hair cells, but its function has not been studied and could be partially redundant to <mark>N-Myc</mark>.
To test for a long-term function of the Mycs in differentiated hair cells, we generated nine unique genotypes knocking out <mark>N-Myc</mark> and/or <mark>L-Myc</mark> after initial formation of hair cells using the well-characterized <mark>Atoh1</mark>-Cre.
We tested functionality of the auditory and vestibular systems at both P21 and four months of age and under the administration of the ototoxic drug cisplatin.
We conclude that neither <mark>N-Myc</mark> nor <mark>L-Myc</mark> is likely to play important roles in long-term hair cell maintenance.
Therefore, it is likely that the late-onset loss of hair cells resulting from early deletion of the <mark>Mycs</mark> leads to an unsustainable developmental defect.
Adipose tissue promotes a serum <mark>cytokine</mark> profile related to lower <mark>insulin</mark> sensitivity after chronic central <mark>leptin</mark> infusion.
Obesity is an inflammatory state characterized by an augment in circulating inflammatory factors.
<mark>Leptin</mark> may modulate the synthesis of these factors by white adipose tissue decreasing <mark>insulin</mark> sensitivity.
We have examined the effect of chronic central administration of <mark>leptin</mark> on circulating levels of <mark>cytokines</mark> and the possible relationship with <mark>cytokine</mark> expression and protein content as well as with <mark>leptin</mark> and <mark>insulin</mark> signaling in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues.
In addition, we analyzed the possible correlation between circulating levels of <mark>cytokines</mark> and peripheral <mark>insulin</mark> resistance.
We studied 18 male Wistar rats divided into controls (C), those treated icv for 14 days with a daily dose of 12 μg of <mark>leptin</mark> (L) and a pair-fed group (PF) that received the same food amount consumed by the <mark>leptin</mark> group.
Serum <mark>leptin</mark> and <mark>insulin</mark> were measured by ELISA, mRNA levels of <mark>interferon-γ</mark> (<mark>IFN-γ</mark>), <mark>interleukin-2</mark> (<mark>IL-2</mark>), <mark>IL-4</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-10</mark> and <mark>tumor necrosis factor-α</mark> (<mark>TNF-α</mark>) by real time PCR and serum and adipose tissue levels of these <mark>cytokines</mark> by multiplexed bead immunoassay.
Serum <mark>leptin</mark>, <mark>IL-2</mark>, <mark>IL-4</mark>, <mark>IFN-γ</mark> and HOMA-IR were increased in L and <mark>TNF-α</mark> was decreased in PF and L. Serum <mark>leptin</mark> and <mark>IL-2</mark> levels correlate positively with HOMA-IR index and negatively with serum glucose levels during an ip <mark>insulin</mark> tolerance test.
In L, an increase in mRNA levels of <mark>IL-2</mark> was found in both adipose depots and <mark>IFN-γ</mark> only in visceral tissue.
Activation of <mark>leptin</mark> signaling was increased and <mark>insulin</mark> signaling decreased in subcutaneous fat of L. In conclusion, <mark>leptin</mark> mediates the production of inflammatory <mark>cytokines</mark> by adipose tissue independent of its effects on food intake, decreasing <mark>insulin</mark> sensitivity.
Critical role of <mark>neuronal pentraxin 1</mark> in mitochondria-mediated hypoxic-ischemic neuronal injury.
Developing brain is highly susceptible to hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury leading to severe neurological disabilities in surviving infants and children.
Previously, we have reported induction of <mark>neuronal pentraxin 1</mark> (<mark>NP1</mark>), a novel neuronal protein of long-pentraxin family, following HI neuronal injury.
Here, we investigated how this specific signal is propagated to cause the HI neuronal death.
We used wild-type (WT) and <mark>NP1</mark> knockout (<mark>NP1</mark>-KO) mouse hippocampal cultures, modeled in vitro following exposure to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), and in vivo neonatal (P9-10) mouse model of HI brain injury.
Our results show induction of <mark>NP1</mark> in primary hippocampal neurons following OGD exposure (4-8 h) and in the ipsilateral hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions at 24-48 h post-HI compared to the contralateral side.
We also found increased <mark>PTEN</mark> activity concurrent with OGD time-dependent (4-8 h) dephosphorylation of <mark>Akt</mark> (Ser473) and <mark>GSK-3β</mark> (Ser9).
OGD also caused a time-dependent decrease in the phosphorylation of Bad (Ser136), and <mark>Bax</mark> protein levels.
Immunofluorescence staining and subcellular fractionation analyses revealed increased mitochondrial translocation of <mark>Bad</mark> and <mark>Bax</mark> proteins from cytoplasm following OGD (4 h) and simultaneously increased release of <mark>Cyt C</mark> from mitochondria followed by activation of <mark>caspase-3</mark>.
<mark>NP1</mark> protein was immunoprecipitated with <mark>Bad</mark> and <mark>Bax</mark> proteins; OGD caused increased interactions of <mark>NP1</mark> with <mark>Bad</mark> and <mark>Bax</mark>, thereby, facilitating their mitochondrial translocation and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ(m)).
This <mark>NP1</mark> induction preceded the increased mitochondrial release of <mark>cytochrome C</mark> (<mark>Cyt C</mark>) into the cytosol, activation of <mark>caspase-3</mark> and OGD time-dependent cell death in WT primary hippocampal neurons.
In contrast, in <mark>NP1</mark>-KO neurons there was no translocation of <mark>Bad</mark> and <mark>Bax</mark> from cytosol to the mitochondria, and no evidence of ΔΨ(m) loss, increased <mark>Cyt C</mark> release and <mark>caspase-3</mark> activation following OGD; which resulted in significantly reduced neuronal death.
Our results indicate a regulatory role of <mark>NP1</mark> in Bad/<mark>Bax</mark>-dependent mitochondrial release of <mark>Cyt C</mark> and <mark>caspase-3</mark> activation.
Together our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which <mark>NP1</mark> regulates mitochondria-driven hippocampal cell death; suggesting <mark>NP1</mark> as a potential therapeutic target against HI brain injury in neonates.
<mark>Sphingosine kinase 1</mark> is required for mesothelioma cell proliferation: role of <mark>histone</mark> acetylation.
BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a devastating disease with an overall poor prognosis.
Despite the recent advances in targeted molecular therapies, there is a clear and urgent need for the identification of novel mesothelioma targets for the development of highly efficacious therapeutics.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we report that the expression of <mark>Sphingosine Kinase 1</mark> (<mark>SphK1</mark>) protein was preferentially elevated in MPM tumor tissues (49 epithelioid and 13 sarcomatoid) compared to normal tissue (n = 13).
In addition, we also observed significantly elevated levels of <mark>SphK1</mark> and <mark>SphK2</mark> mRNA and <mark>SphK1</mark> protein expression in MPM cell lines such as H2691, H513 and H2461 compared to the non-malignant mesothelial Met5 cells.
The underlying mechanism appears to be mediated by <mark>SphK1</mark> induced upregulation of select gene transcription programs such as that of <mark>CBP</ma<mark>CBP/p300</m<mark>p300</mark> and <mark>PCAF</mark>, two <mark>histone acetyl transferases</mark> (<mark>HAT</mark>), and the down regulation of <mark>cell cycle dependent kinase inhibitor</mark> genes such as <mark>p27Kip1</mark> and <mark>p21Cip1</mark>.
In addition, using immunoprecipitates of anti-acetylated <mark>histone</mark> antibody from <mark>SphK</mark> inhibitor, <mark>SphK</mark>-I2 treated Met5A and H2691 cell lysates, we also showed activation of other cell proliferation related genes, such as <mark>Top2A</mark> (DNA replication), <mark>AKB</mark> (chromosome remodeling and mitotic spindle formation), and suppression of <mark>p21 CIP1</mark> and <mark>p27KIP1</mark>.
The <mark>CDK2</mark>, <mark>HAT1</mark> and <mark>MYST2</mark> were, however, unaffected in the above study.
Using <mark>SphK</mark> inhibitor and specific siRNA targeting either <mark>SphK1</mark> or <mark>SphK2</mark>, we also unequivocally established that <mark>SphK1</mark>, but not <mark>SphK2</mark>, promotes H2691 mesothelioma cell proliferation.
Using a multi-walled carbon nanotubes induced peritoneal mesothelioma mouse model, we showed that the <mark>SphK1</mark>-/- null mice exhibited significantly less inflammation and granulamatous nodules compared to their wild type counterparts.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The <mark>lipid kinase</mark> <mark>SphK1</mark> plays a positive and essential role in the growth and development of malignant mesothelioma and is therefore a likely therapeutic target.
The hereditary spastic paraplegia protein <mark>strumpellin</mark>: characterisation in neurons and of the effect of disease mutations on <mark>WASH</mark> complex assembly and function.
Mutations in the gene encoding <mark>strumpellin</mark> cause autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), in which there is degeneration of corticospinal tract axons.
<mark>Strumpellin</mark> is a component of the <mark>WASH</mark> complex, an actin-regulating complex that is recruited to endosomes by interactions with the retromer complex.
The <mark>WASH</mark> complex and its relationship to retromer have not been fully characterised in neurons, and the molecular pathological mechanism of <mark>strumpellin</mark> mutation is unclear.
Here we demonstrate that the <mark>WASH</mark> complex assembles in the brain, where it interacts with retromer.
Members of both complexes co-localise with each other and with endosomes in primary cortical neurons, and are present in somato-dendritic and axonal compartments.
We show that <mark>strumpellin</mark> is not required for normal <mark>transferrin receptor</mark> traffic, but is required for the correct subcellular distribution of the <mark>β-2-adrenergic receptor</mark>.
However, <mark>strumpellin</mark> disease mutations do not affect its incorporation into the <mark>WASH</mark> complex or its subcellular localisation, nor do they have a dominant effect on functions of the <mark>WASH</mark> complex, including regulation of endosomal tubulation, <mark>transferrin receptor</mark> traffic or <mark>β-2-adrenergic receptor</mark> localisation.
Models of the <mark>WASH</mark> complex indicate that it contains a single <mark>strumpellin</mark> molecule, so in patients with <mark>strumpellin</mark> mutations, complexes containing wild-type and mutant <mark>strumpellin</mark> should be present in equal numbers.
In most cell types this would provide sufficient functional <mark>WASH</mark> to allow normal cellular physiology.
However, owing to the demands on membrane traffic imposed by their exceptionally long axons, we suggest that corticospinal neurons are especially vulnerable to reductions in functional <mark>WASH</mark>.
Characterization and identification of subpopulations of mononuclear preosteoclasts induced by <mark>TNF-α</mark> in combination with <mark>TGF-β</mark> in rats.
Osteoclasts are unique multinucleated cells formed by fusion of preosteoclasts derived from cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, which are induced by <mark>RANKL</mark>.
However, characteristics and subpopulations of osteoclast precursor cells are poorly understood.
We show here that a combination of <mark>TNF-α</mark>, <mark>TGF-β</mark>, and <mark>M-CSF</mark> efficiently generates mononuclear preosteoclasts but not multinucleate<mark>d</mark> osteoclasts (MNCs) in rat bone marrow cultures depleted of stromal cells.
Using a rat osteoclast-specific mAb, <mark>Kat1</mark>, we found that <mark>TNF-α</mark> and <mark>TGF-β</mark> specifically increased <mark>Kat1</mark>(+)<mark>c-fms</mark>(+) and <mark>Kat1</mark>(+)<mark>c-fms</mark>(-) cells but not <mark>Kat1</mark>(-)<mark>c-fms</mark>(+) cells.
<mark>Kat1</mark>(-)<mark>c-fms</mark>(+) cells appeared in early stages of culture, but <mark>Kat1</mark>(+)<mark>c-fms</mark>(+) and <mark>Kat1</mark>(+)<mark>c-fms</mark>(-) cells increased later.
Preosteoclasts induced by <mark>TNF-α</mark>, <mark>TGF-β</mark>, and <mark>M-CSF</mark> rapidly differentiated into osteoclasts in the presence of <mark>RANKL</mark> and hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis, suggesting that preosteoclasts are terminally differentiated cells.
We further analyzed the expression levels of genes encoding surface proteins in bone marrow macrophages (BMM), preosteoclasts, and MNCs.
Preosteoclasts expressed <mark>itgam</mark> (<mark>CD11b</mark>) and chemokine receptors <mark>CCR1</mark> and <mark>CCR2</mark>; however, in preosteoclasts the expression of <mark>chemokine receptors</mark> <mark>CCR1</mark> and <mark>CCR2</mark> was not up-regulated compared to their expression in BMM.
However, addition of <mark>RANKL</mark> to preosteoclasts markedly increased the expression of <mark>CCR1</mark>.
In contrast, expression of macrophage antigen <mark>emr-1</mark> (<mark>F4/80</mark>) and <mark>chemokine receptor</mark> <mark>CCR5</mark> was down-regulated in preosteoclasts.
The combination of <mark>TNF-α</mark>, <mark>TGF-β</mark>, and <mark>M-CSF</mark> induced <mark>Kat1</mark>(+)<mark>CD11b</mark>(+) cells, but these cells were also induced by <mark>TNF-α</mark> alone.
In addition, <mark>MIP-1α</mark> and <mark>MCP-1</mark>, which are ligands for <mark>CCR1</mark> and <mark>CCR2</mark>, were chemotactic for preosteoclasts, and promoted multinucleation of preosteoclasts.
Finally, we found that <mark>Kat1</mark>(+)<mark>c-fms</mark>(+) cells were present in bone tissues of rats with adjuvant arthritis.
These data demonstrate that <mark>TNF-α</mark> in combination with <mark>TGF-β</mark> efficiently generates preosteoclasts in vitro.
We delineated characteristics that are useful for identifying and isolating rat preosteoclasts, and found that <mark>CCR1</mark> expression was regulated in the fusion step in osteoclastogenesis.
The <mark>immunoglobulin</mark> domain of the <mark>sodium channel β3 subunit</mark> contains a surface-localized disulfide bond that is required for homophilic binding.
The β subunits of <mark>voltage-gated sodium (Na(v)) channels</mark> possess an extracellular <mark>immunoglobulin</mark> (<mark>Ig</mark>) domain that is related to the <mark>L1 family of cell-adhesion molecules</mark> (<mark>CAMs</mark>).
Here we show that in HEK293 cells, secretion of the free <mark>Ig</mark> domain of the <mark>β3 subunit</mark> is reduced significantly when it is coexpressed with the full-length <mark>β3</mark> and <mark>β1</mark> subunits but not with the <mark>β2</mark> subunit.
Using immunoprecipitation, we show that the <mark>β3 subunit</mark> can mediate trans homophilic-binding via its <mark>Ig</mark> domain and that the <mark>β3</mark>-<mark>Ig</mark> domain can associate heterophilically with the <mark>β1</mark> subunit.
Evolutionary tracing analysis and structural modeling identified a cluster of surface-localized amino acids fully conserved between the <mark>Ig</mark> domains of all known <mark>β3</mark> and <mark>β1</mark> sequences.
A notable feature of this conserved surface cluster is the presence of two adjacent cysteine residues that previously we have suggested may form a disulfide bond.
We now confirm the presence of the disulfide bond in <mark>β3</mark> using mass spectrometry, and we show that its integrity is essential for the association of the full-length, membrane-anchored <mark>β3 subunit</mark> with itself.
However, selective reduction of this surface disulfide bond did not inhibit homophilic binding of the purified <mark>β3</mark>-<mark>Ig</mark> domain in free solution.
Hence, the disulfide bond itself is unlikely to be part of the homophilic binding site.
Rather, we suggest that its integrity ensures the <mark>Ig</mark> domain of the membrane-tethered <mark>
β3 subunit</mark> adopts the correct orientation for productive association to occur in vivo.
<mark>Scribble</mark> is required for normal epithelial cell-cell contacts and lumen morphogenesis in the mammalian lung.
During lung development, proper epithelial cell arrangements are critical for the formation of an arborized network of tubes.
Each tube requires a lumen, the diameter of which must be tightly regulated to enable optimal lung function.
Lung branching and lumen morphogenesis require close epithelial cell-cell contacts that are maintained as a result of adherens junctions, tight junctions and by intact apical-basal (A/B) polarity.
However, the molecular mechanisms that maintain epithelial cohesion and lumen diameter in the mammalian lung are unknown.
Here we show that <mark>Scribble</mark>, a protein implicated in planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling, is necessary for normal lung morphogenesis.
Lungs of the <mark>Scrib</mark> mouse mutant <mark>Circletail (Crc)</mark> are abnormally shaped with fewer airways, and these airways often lack a visible, 'open' lumen.
Mechanistically we show that <mark>Scrib</mark> genetically interacts with the core PCP gene <mark>Vangl2</mark> in the developing lung and that the distribution of PCP pathway proteins and <mark>Rho</mark> mediated cytoskeletal modification is perturbed in <mark>Scrib</mark>(<mark>Crc</mark>/<mark>Crc</mark>) lungs.
However A/B polarity, which is disrupted in Drosophila <mark>Scrib</mark> mutants, is largely unaffected.
Notably, we find that <mark>Scrib</mark> mediates functions not attributed to other PCP proteins in the lung.
Specifically, <mark>Scrib</mark> localises to both adherens and tight junctions of lung epithelia and knockdown of <mark>Scrib</mark> in lung explants and organotypic cultures leads to reduced cohesion of lung epithelial cells.
Live imaging of <mark>Scrib</mark> knockdown lungs shows that <mark>Scrib</mark> does not affect bud bifurcation, as previously shown for the PCP protein <mark>Celsr1</mark>, but is required to maintain epithelial cohesion.
To understand the mechanism leading to reduced cell-cell association, we show that <mark>Scrib</mark> associates with <mark>β-catenin</mark> in embryonic lung and the sub-cellular distribution of adherens and tight junction proteins is perturbed in mutant lung epithelia.
Our data reveal that <mark>Scrib</mark> is required for normal lung epithelial organisation and lumen morphogenesis by maintaining cell-cell contacts.
Thus we reveal novel and important roles for <mark>Scrib</mark> in lung development operating via the PCP pathway, and in regulating junctional complexes and cell cohesion.
What can naturally occurring mutations tell us about <mark>Ca(v)1.x channel</mark> function?
<mark>Voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels</mark> allow for Ca²⁺-dependent intracellular signaling by directly mediating Ca²⁺ ion influx, by physical coupling to intracellular <mark>Ca²⁺ release channels</mark> or functional coupling to other <mark>ion channels</mark> such as <mark>Ca²⁺ activated potassium channels</mark>.
<mark>L-type Ca²⁺ channels</mark> that comprise the family of <mark>Ca(v)1 channels</mark> are expressed in many electrically excitable tissues and are characterized by their unique sensitivity to dihydropyridines.
In this issue, we summarize genetic defects in <mark>L-type Ca²⁺ channels</mark> and analyze their role in human diseases (Ca²⁺ channelopathies); e.g. mutations in <mark>Ca(v)1.2 α1</mark> cause Timothy and Brugada syndrome, mutations in <mark>Ca(v)1.3 α1</mark> are linked to sinoatrial node dysfunction and deafness while mutations in <mark>Ca(v)1.4 α1</mark> are associated with X-linked retinal disorders such as an incomplete form of congenital stationary night blindness.
Herein, we also put the mutations underlying the channel's dysfunction into the structural context of the pore-forming α1 subunit.
This analysis highlights the importance of combining functional data with structural analysis to gain a deeper understanding for the disease pathophysiology as well as for physiological channel function.
This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: <mark>Calcium channels</mark>.
Overexpression of human <mark>selenoprotein H</mark> in neuronal cells enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and function through activation of <mark>protein kinase A</mark>, <mark>protein kinase B</mark>, and <mark>cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein</mark> pathway.
Mitochondrial biogenesis is activated by <mark>nuclear encoded transcription co-activator peroxis<mark>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α</mark> (<mark>PGC-1α</mark>), which is regulated by several upstream factors including <mark>protein kinase A</mark> and <mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>protein kinase B</mark>.
We have previously shown that <mark>selenoprotein H</mark> enhances the levels of nuclear regulators for mitochondrial biogenesis, increases mitochondrial mass and improves mitochondrial respiratory rate, under physiological condition.
Furthermore, overexpression of <mark>selenoprotein H</mark> protects neuronal HT22 cells from ultraviolet B irradiation-induced cell damage by lowering reactive oxygen species production, and inhibiting activation of <mark>caspase-3 and -9</mark>, as well as <mark>p53</mark>.
The objective of this study is to identify the cell signaling pathways by which <mark>selenoprotein H</mark> initiates mitochondrial biogenesis.
We first confirmed our previous observation that <mark>selenoprotein H</mark> transfected HT22 cells increased the protein levels of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial biogenesis factors, <mark>peroxis<mark>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α</mark>> <mark>nuclear respiratory factor 1</mark> and <mark>mitochondrial transcription factor A</mark>.
We then observed that total and phosphorylation of <mark>protein kinase A</mark>, <mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>protein kinase B</mark> and <mark>cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein</mark> (<mark>CREB</mark>) were significantly increased in <mark>selenoprotein H</mark> transfected cells compared to vector transfected HT22 cells.
To verify whether the observed stimulating effects on mitochondrial biogenesis pathways are caused by <mark>selenoprotein H</mark> and mediated through <mark>CREB</mark>, we knocked down <mark>selenoprotein H</mark> mRNA level using siRNA and inhibited <mark>CREB</mark> with napthol AS-E phosphate in <mark>selenoprotein H</mark> transfected cells and repeated the measurements of the aforementioned biomarkers.
Our results revealed that silencing of <mark>selenoprotein H</mark> not only decreased the protein levels of <mark>PGC-1α</mark>, <mark>nuclear respiratory factor 1</mark> and <mark>mitochondrial transcription factor A</mark>, but also decreased the total and phosphorylation levels of <mark>protein kinase A</mark>, <mark>protein kinase B</mark>, and <mark>CREB</mark>.
Similarly, <mark>CREB</mark> inhibition reduced <mark>CREB</mark> activation and <mark>PGC-1α</mark> protein levels in <mark>selenoprotein H</mark> transfected cells.
Moreover, <mark>selenoprotein H</mark> transfection increased the activity of mitochondrial complexes and prevented the ultraviolet B induced fall of mitochondrial membrane potential.
We conclude that the effects of <mark>selenoprotein H</mark> on mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial function are probably mediated through <mark>protein kinase A</mark>-<mark>CREB</mark>-<mark>PGC-1α</mark> and <mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>protein kinase B</mark>-<mark>CREB</mark>-<mark>PGC-1α</mark> pathways.
Prohibitins and the cytoplasmic domain of <mark>CD86</mark> cooperate to mediate <mark>CD86</mark> signaling in B lymphocytes.
<mark>CD86</mark> engagement on a <mark>CD40L</mark>/<mark>IL-4</mark>-primed murine B cell activates signaling intermediates that promote NF-κB activation to increase <mark>Oct-2</mark> and mature <mark>IgG1</mark> mRNA and protein expression, as well as the rate of <mark>IgG1</mark> transcription, without affecting class switch recombination.
One of the most proximal signaling intermediates identified is <mark>phospholipase Cγ2</mark>, a protein reported to bind tyrosine residues, which are absent in the cytoplasmic domain of <mark>CD86</mark>.
Using a proteomics-based identification approach, we show that the tyrosine-containing transmembrane adaptor proteins <mark>prohibitin</mark> (<mark>Phb)1</mark> and <mark>Phb2</mark> bind to <mark>CD86</mark>.
The basal expression of <mark>Phb1/2</mark> and association with <mark>CD86</mark> was low in resting B cells, whereas the level of expression and association increased primarily after priming with <mark>CD40</mark>.
The <mark>CD86</mark>-induced increase in <mark>Oct-2</mark> and <mark>IgG1</mark> was less when either <mark>Phb1/2</mark> expression was reduced by short hairpin RNA or the cytoplasmic domain of <mark>CD86</mark> was truncated or mutated at serine/threonine <mark>protein kinase C</mark> phosphorylation sites, which did not affect <mark>Phb1/2</mark> binding to <mark>CD86</mark>.
Using this approach, we also show that <mark>Phb1/2</mark> and the <mark>CD86</mark> cytoplasmic domain are required for the <mark>CD86</mark>-induced phosphorylation of <mark>IκBα</mark>, which we previously reported leads to <mark>NF-κB p50/p65</mark> activation, whereas only <mark>Phb1/2</mark> was required for the <mark>CD86</mark>-induced phosphorylation of <mark>phospholipase Cγ2</mark> and <mark>protein kinase Cα/β(II)</mark>, which we have previously reported leads to <mark>NF-κB (p65)</mark> phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation.
Taken together, these findings suggest that <mark>Phb1/2</mark> and the <mark>CD86</mark> cytoplasmic domain cooperate to mediate <mark>CD86</mark> signaling in a B cell through differential phosphorylation of distal signaling intermediates required to increase <mark>IgG1</mark>.
Gastric expression of <mark>plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1</mark> is associated with hyperphagia and obesity in mice.
The <mark>adipokine</mark> <mark>plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1</mark> is increased in plasma of obese individuals and exhibits increased expression in the stomachs of individuals infected with Helicobacter.
To investigate the relevance of gastric <mark>PAI-1</mark>, we used 1.1 kb of the <mark>H(+)/K(+)β subunit</mark> promoter to overexpress <mark>PAI-1</mark> specifically in mouse gastric parietal cells (<mark>PAI-1</mark>-<mark>H/Kβ</mark> mice).
We studied the physiological, biochemical, and behavioral characteristics of these and mice null for <mark>PAI-1</mark> or a putative receptor, <mark>urokinase plasminogen activator receptor</mark> (<mark>uPAR</mark>).
<mark>PAI-1</mark>-<mark>H/Kβ</mark> mice had increased plasma concentrations of <mark>PAI-1</mark> and increased body mass, adiposity, and hyperphagia compared with wild-type mice.
In the latter, food intake was inhibited by cholecystokinin (<mark>CCK</mark>)8s, but <mark>PAI-1</mark>-<mark>H/Kβ</mark> mice were insensitive to the satiating effects of <mark>CCK8s</mark>.
<mark>PAI-1</mark>-<mark>H/Kβ</mark> mice also had significantly reduced expression of <mark>c-fos</mark> in the nucleus tractus solitarius in response to <mark>CCK8s</mark> and refeeding compared with wild-type mice.
Exogenous <mark>PAI-1</mark> reversed the effects of <mark>CCK8s</mark> on food intake and <mark>c-fos</mark> levels in the nucleus tractus solitarius of wild-type mice, but not <mark>uPAR</mark>-null mice.
Infection of C57BL/6 mice with Helicobacter felis increased gastric abundance of <mark>PAI-1</mark> and reduced the satiating effects of <mark>CCK8s</mark>, whereas the response to <mark>CCK8s</mark> was maintained in infected <mark>PAI-1</mark>-null mice.
In cultured vagal afferent neurons, <mark>PAI-1</mark> inhibited stimulation of <mark>neuropeptide Y type 2 receptor</mark> (<mark>Y2R</mark>) expression by <mark>CCK8s</mark>.
Thus, gastric expression of <mark>PAI-1</mark> is associated with hyperphagia, moderate obesity, and resistance to the satiating effects of <mark>CCK</mark> indicating a new role in suppressing signals from the upper gut that inhibit food intake.
Context- and cell-dependent effects of <mark>Delta-like 4</mark> targeting in the bone marrow microenvironment.
<mark>Delta-like 4</mark> (<mark>Dll4</mark>) is a ligand of the <mark>Notch</mark> pathway family which has been widely studied in the context of tumor angiogenesis, its blockade shown to result in non-productive angiogenesis and halted tumor growth.
As <mark>Dll4</mark> inhibitors enter the clinic, there is an emerging need to understand their side effects, namely the systemic consequences of <mark>Dll4</mark>:<mark>Notch</mark> blockade in tissues other than tumors.
The present study focused on the effects of systemic anti-<mark>Dll4</mark> targeting in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment.
Here we show that <mark>Dll4</mark> blockade with monoclonal antibodies perturbs the BM vascular niche of sub-lethally irradiated mice, resulting in increased <mark>CD31</mark>(+), <mark>VE-Cadherin</mark>(+) and <mark>c-kit</mark>(+) vessel density, and also increased megakaryocytes, whereas <mark>CD105</mark>(+), <mark>VEGFR3</mark>(+), <mark>SMA</mark>(+) and lectin(+) vessel density remained unaltered.
We investigated also the expression of angiocrine genes upon <mark>Dll4</mark> treatment in vivo, and demonstrate that <mark>IGFbp2</mark>, <mark>IGFbp3</mark>, <mark>Angpt2</mark>, <mark>Dll4</mark>, <mark>DHH</mark> and <mark>VEGF-A</mark> are upregulated, while <mark>FGF1</mark> and <mark>CSF2</mark> are reduced.
In vitro treatment of endothelial cells with anti-<mark>Dll4</mark> reduced <mark>Akt</mark> phosphorylation while maintaining similar levels of <mark>Erk 1/2</mark> phosphorylation.
Besides its effects in the BM vascular niche, anti-<mark>Dll4</mark> treatment perturbed hematopoiesis, as evidenced by increased myeloid (<mark>CD11b</mark>(+)), decreased B (<mark>B220</mark>(+)) and T (<mark>CD3</mark>(+)) lymphoid BM content of treated mice, with a corresponding increase in myeloid circulating cells.
Moreover, anti-<mark>Dll4</mark> treatment also increased the number of CFU-M and -G colonies in methylcellulose assays, independently of <mark>Notch1</mark>.
Finally, anti-<mark>Dll4</mark> treatment of donor BM improved the hematopoietic recovery of lethally irradiated recipients in a transplant setting.
Together, our data reveals the hematopoietic (BM) effects of systemic anti-<mark>Dll4</mark> treatment result from qualitative vascular changes and also direct hematopoietic cell modulation, which may be favorable in a transplant setting.
Keratinocyte overexpression of <mark>IL-17C</mark> promotes psoriasiform skin inflammation.
<mark>IL-17C</mark> is a functionally distinct member of the <mark>IL-17</mark> family that binds <mark>IL-17 receptor E/A</mark> to promote innate defense in epithelial cells and regulate Th17 cell differentiation.
We demonstrate that <mark>IL-17C</mark> (not <mark>IL-17A</mark>) is the most abundant <mark>IL-17</mark> isoform in lesional psoriasis skin (1058 versus 8 pg/ml; p &lt; 0.006) and localizes to keratinocytes (KCs), endothelial cells (ECs), and leukocytes.
ECs stimulated with <mark>IL-17C</mark> produce increased <mark>TNF-alpha</mark> and KCs stimulated with <mark>IL-17C</mark>/<mark>TNF-alpha</mark> produce similar inflammatory gene response patterns as those elicited by <mark>IL-17A</mark>/<mark>TNF-alpha</mark>, including increases in <mark>IL-17C</mark>, <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>, <mark>IL-8</mark>, <mark>IL-1alpha/beta</mark>, <mark>IL-1F5</mark>, <mark>IL-1F9</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-19</mark>, <mark>CCL20</mark>, <mark>S100A7/A8/A9</mark>, <mark>DEFB4</mark>, <mark>lipocalin 2</mark>, and <mark>peptidase inhibitor 3</mark> (p &lt; 0.05), indicating a positive proinflammatory feedback loop between the epidermis and ECs.
Psoriasis patients treated with etanercept rapidly decrease cutaneous <mark>IL-17C</mark> levels, suggesting <mark>IL-17C</mark>/<mark>TNF-alpha</mark>-mediated inflammatory signaling is critical for psoriasis pathogenesis.
Mice genetically engineered to overexpress <mark>IL-17C</mark> in KCs develop well-demarcated areas of erythematous, flakey involved skin adjacent to areas of normal-appearing uninvolved skin despite increased <mark>IL-17C</mark> expression in both areas (p &lt; 0.05).
Uninvolved skin displays increased angiogenesis and elevated <mark>S100A8/A9</mark> expression (p &lt; 0.05) but no epidermal hyperplasia, whereas involved skin exhibits robust epidermal hyperplasia, increased angiogenesis and leukocyte infiltration, and upregulated <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>, <mark>IL-1alpha/beta</mark>, <mark>IL-17A/F</mark>, <mark>IL-23p19</mark>, <mark>vascular endothelial growth factor</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, and <mark>CCL20</mark> (p &lt; 0.05), suggesting that <mark>IL-17C</mark>, when coupled with other proinflammatory signals, initiates the development of psoriasiform dermatitis.
This skin phenotype was significantly improved following 8 wk of <mark>TNF-alpha</mark> inhibition.
These findings identify a role for <mark>IL-17C</mark> in skin inflammation and suggest a pathogenic function for the elevated <mark>IL-17C</mark> observed in lesional psoriasis skin.
<mark>β-catenin</mark> is essential for efficient in vitro premyogenic mesoderm formation but can be partially compensated by retinoic acid signalling.
Previous studies have shown that P19 cells expressing a dominant negative <mark>β-catenin</mark> mutant (<mark>β-cat</<mark>β-ca</mark>>/EnR) cannot undergo myogenic differentiation in the presence or absence of muscle-inducing levels of retinoic acid (RA).
While RA could upregulate premyogenic mesoderm expression, including <mark>Pax3/7</mark> and <mark>Meox1</mark>, only <mark>Pax3/7</mark> and <mark>Gli2</mark> could be upregulated by RA in the presence of <mark>β-cat</mark>/EnR. However, the use of a dominant negative construct that cannot be compensated by other factors is limiting due to the possibility of negative chromatin remodelling overriding compensatory mechanisms.
In this study, we set out to determine if <mark>β-catenin</mark> function is essential for myogenesis with and without RA, by creating P19 cells with reduced <mark>β-catenin</mark> transcriptional activity using an shRNA approach, termed P19[sh<mark>β-cat</mark>] cells.
The loss of <mark>β-catenin</mark> resulted in a reduction of skeletal myogenesis in the absence of RA as early as premyogenic mesoderm, with the loss of <mark>Pax3/7</mark>, <mark>Eya2</mark>, <mark>Six1</mark>, <mark>Meox1</mark>, <mark>Gli2</mark>, <mark>Foxc1/2</mark>, and <mark>Sox7</mark> transcript levels.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation identified an association of <mark>β-catenin</mark> with the promoter region of the <mark>Sox7</mark> gene.
Differentiation of P19[sh<mark>β-cat</mark>] cells in the presence of RA resulted in the upregulation or lack of repression of all of the precursor genes, on day 5 and/or 9, with the exception of <mark>Foxc2</mark>.
However, expression of <mark>Sox7</mark>, <mark>Gli2</mark>, the myogenic regulatory factors and terminal differentiation markers remained inhibited on day 9 and overall skeletal myogenesis was reduced.
Thus, <mark>β-catenin</mark> is essential for in vitro formation of premyogenic mesoderm, leading to skeletal myogenesis.
RA can at least partially compensate for the loss of <mark>β-catenin</mark> in the expression of many myogenic precursor genes, but not for myoblast gene expression or overall myogenesis.
Chronic <mark>Akt</mark> activation attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced cardiac dysfunction via <mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>GSK3beta</mark>-dependent inhibition of apoptosis and ER stress.
Sepsis is characterized by systematic inflammation and contributes to cardiac dysfunction.
This study was designed to examine the effect of <mark>protein kinase B</mark> (<mark>Akt</mark>) activation on lipopolysaccharide-induced cardiac anomalies and underlying mechanism(s) involved.
Mechanical and intracellular Ca2+ properties were examined in myocardium from wild-type and transgenic mice with cardiac-specific chronic <mark>Akt</mark> overexpression following LPS (4 mg/kg, i.p.) challenge.
<mark>Akt</mark> signaling cascade (<mark>Akt</mark>, <mark>phosphatase and tensin homologue</mark> deleted on chromosome ten, <mark>glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta</mark>), stress signal (<mark>extracellular-signal-regulated kinases</mark>, <mark>c-Jun N-terminal kinases</mark>, <mark>p38</mark>), apoptotic markers (<mark>Bcl-2 associated X protein</mark>, <mark>caspase-3/-9</mark>), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (<mark>glucose-regulated protein 78</mark>, <mark>growth arrest and DNA damage induced gene-153</mark>, <mark>eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha</mark>), inflammatory markers (<mark>tumor necrosis factor alpha</mark>, <mark>interleukin-1beta</mark>, <mark>interleukin-6</mark>) and autophagic markers (<mark>Beclin-1</mark>, <mark>light chain 3B</mark>, <mark>autophagy-related gene 7</mark> and <mark>sequestosome 1</mark>) were evaluated.
Our results revealed that LPS induced marked decrease in ejection fraction, fractional shortening, cardiomyocyte contractile capacity with dampened intracellular Ca2+ release and clearance, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and decreased glutathione and glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) ratio, increased <mark>ERK</mark>, <mark>JNK</mark>, <mark>p38</mark>, <mark>GRP78</mark>, <mark>Gadd153</mark>, <mark>eIF2alpha</mark>, <mark>BAX</mark>, <mark>caspase-3 and -9</mark>, downregulated <mark>B cell lymphoma 2</mark> (<mark>Bcl-2</mark>), the effects of which were significantly attenuated or obliterated by <mark>Akt</mark> activation.
<mark>Akt</mark> activation itself did not affect cardiac contractile and intracellular Ca2+ properties, ROS production, oxidative stress, apoptosis and ER stress.
In addition, LPS upregulated levels of <mark>Beclin-1</mark>, <mark>LC3B</mark> and <mark>Atg7</mark>, while suppressing <mark>p62</mark> accumulation.
<mark>Akt</mark> activation did not affect <mark>Beclin-1</mark>, <mark>LC3B</mark>, <mark>Atg7</mark> and <mark>p62</mark> in the presence or absence of LPS.
<mark>Akt</mark> overexpression promoted phosphorylation of <mark>Akt</mark> and <mark>GSK3beta</mark>.
In vitro study using the <mark>GSK3beta</mark> inhibitor SB216763 mimicked the response elicited by chronic <mark>Akt</mark> activation.
Taken together, these data showed that <mark>Akt</mark> activation ameliorated LPS-induced cardiac contractile and intracellular Ca2+ anomalies through inhibition of apoptosis and ER stress, possibly involving an <mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>GSK3beta</mark>-dependent mechanism.
Aberrant <mark>Mer receptor tyrosine kinase</mark> expression contributes to leukemogenesis in acute myeloid leukemia.
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) continues to be extremely difficult to treat successfully, and the unacceptably low overall survival rates mandate that we assess new potential therapies to ameliorate poor clinical response to conventional therapy.
Abnormal <mark>tyrosine kinase</mark> activation in AML has been associated with poor prognosis and provides strategic targets for novel therapy development.
We found that <mark>Mer receptor tyrosine kinase</mark> was over-expressed in a majority of pediatric (29/36, 80%) and adult (10/10, 100%) primary AML patient blasts at the time of diagnosis, and 100% of patient samples at the time of relapse.
<mark>Mer</mark> was also found to be expressed in 12 of 14 AML cell lines (86%).
In contrast, normal bone marrow myeloid precursors expressed little to no <mark>Mer</mark>.
Following AML cell line stimulation with <mark>Gas6</mark>, a <mark>Mer lig<mark>Mer</mark></mark>, we observed activation of prosurvival and proliferative signaling pathways, including phosphorylation of <mark>ERK1/2</mark>, <mark>p38</mark>, <mark>MSK1</mark>, <mark>CREB</mark>, <mark>ATF1</mark>, <mark>AKT</mark> and <mark>STAT6</mark>.
To assess the phenotypic role of <mark>Mer</mark> in AML, two independent short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs were used to decrease <mark>Mer</mark> expression in the AML cell lines Nomo-1 and Kasumi-1.
Reduction of <mark>Mer</mark> protein levels significantly increased rates of myeloblast apoptosis two to threefold in response to serum starvation.
Furthermore, myeloblasts with knocked-down <mark>Mer</mark> demonstrated decreased colony formation by 67-87%, relative to control cell lines (P<0.01).
NOD-SCID-gamma mice transplanted with Nomo-1 myeloblasts with reduced levels of <mark>Mer</mark> had a significant prolongation in survival compared with mice transplanted with the parental or control cell lines (median survival 17 days in parental and control cell lines, versus 32-36 days in <mark>Mer</mark> knockdown cell lines, P<0.0001).
These data suggest a role for <mark>Mer</mark> in acute myeloid leukemogenesis and indicate that targeted inhibition of <mark>Mer</mark> may be an effective therapeutic strategy in pediatric and adult AML.
<mark>OX40L</mark>/<mark>Jagged1</mark> cosignaling by <mark>GM-CSF</mark>-induced bone marrow-derived dendritic cells is required for the expansion of functional regulatory T cells.
Earlier, we had demonstrated that treatment with low dose of <mark>GM-CSF</mark> can prevent the development of experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT), experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis, and type 1 diabetes, and could also reverse ongoing EAT and experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis.
The protective effect was mediated through the induction of tolerogenic <mark>CD11C</mark>(+)<mark>CD8α</mark>(-) dendritic cells (DCs) and consequent expansion of <mark>Foxp3</mark>(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs).
Subsequently, we showed that <mark>GM-CSF</mark> acted specifically on bone marrow precursors and facilitated their differentiation into tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs; <mark>GM-CSF</mark>-induced bone marrow-derived DCs [GM-BMDCs]), which directed Treg expansion in a contact-dependent manner.
This novel mechanism of Treg expansion was independent of <mark>TCR</mark>-mediated signaling but required exogenous <mark>IL-2</mark> and cosignaling from DC-bound <mark>OX40L</mark>.
In this study, we observed that <mark>OX40L</mark>-mediated signaling by GM-BMDCs, although necessary, was not sufficient for Treg expansion and required signaling by <mark>Jagged1</mark>.
Concurrent signaling induced by <mark>OX40L</mark> and <mark>Jagged1</mark> via <mark>OX40</m<mark>OX40 and Notch3 <mark>Notch3</mark>ors</mark> expressed on Tregs was essential for the Treg expansion with sustained <mark>FoxP3</mark> expression.
Adoptive transfer of only <mark>OX40L</mark>(+)<mark>Jagged1</mark>(+) BMDCs led to Treg expansion, increased production of <mark>IL-4</mark> and <mark>IL-10</mark>, and suppression of EAT in the recipient mice.
These results showed a critical role for <mark>OX40L</mark>- and <mark>Jagged1</mark>-induced cosignaling in GM-BMDC-induced Treg expansion.
The <mark>neuropilin 1</mark> cytoplasmic domain is required for <mark>VEGF-A</mark>-dependent arteriogenesis.
<mark>Neuropilin 1</mark> (<mark>NRP1</mark>) plays an important but ill-defined role in <mark>VEGF-A</mark> signaling and vascular morphogenesis.
We show that mice with a knockin mutation that ablates the <mark>NRP1</mark> cytoplasmic tail (<mark>Nrp1</mark>(cyto)) have normal angiogenesis but impaired developmental and adult arteriogenesis.
The arteriogenic defect was traced to the absence of a PDZ-dependent interaction between <mark>NRP1</mark> and <mark>VEGF receptor 2</mark> (<mark>VEGFR2</mark>) complex and <mark>synectin</mark>, which delayed trafficking of endocytosed <mark>VEGFR2</mark> from <mark>Rab5</mark>+ to <mark>EAA1</mark>+ endosomes.
This led to increased <mark>PTPN1</mark> (<mark>PTP1b</mark>)-mediated dephosphorylation of <mark>VEGFR2</mark> at Y(1175), the site involved in activating <mark>ERK</mark> signaling.
The <mark>Nrp1</mark>(cyto) mutation also impaired endothelial tubulogenesis in vitro, which could be rescued by expressing full-length <mark>NRP1</mark> or constitutively active <mark>ERK</mark>.
These results demonstrate that the <mark>NRP1</mark> cytoplasmic domain promotes <mark>VEGFR2</mark> trafficking in a PDZ-dependent manner to regulate arteriogenic <mark>ERK</mark> signaling and establish a role for <mark>NRP1</mark> in <mark>VEGF-A</mark> signaling during vascular morphogenesis.
<mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark> inhibitor PF-04691502 antitumor activity is enhanced with induction of wild-type <mark>TP53</mark> in human xenograft and murine knockout models of head and neck cancer.
PURPOSE: <mark>Phosphoinositide 3-kinase</mark> (<mark>PI3K</mark>)/<mark>mammalian target of rapamycin</mark> (<mark>mTOR</mark>) pathway activation is often associated with altered expression or mutations of <mark>PIK3CA</mark>, <mark>TP53</mark>/<mark>p73</mark>, <mark>PTEN</mark>, and <mark>TGF-beta receptors</mark> (<mark>TGFBR</mark>) in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC).
However, little is known about how these alterations affect response to <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark>-targeted agents.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this preclinical study, <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark> signaling was characterized in nine HNSCC (UM-SCC) cell lines and human oral keratinocytes.
We investigated the molecular and anticancer effects of dual <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark> inhibitor PF-04691502(PF-502) in UM-SCC expressing <mark>PIK3CA</mark> with decreased wild-type <mark>TP53</mark>, mutant <mark>TP53</mark>-/+ mutant<mark>TGFBR2</mark>, and in HNSCC of a conditional <mark>Pten</mark>/<mark>Tgfbr1</mark> double knockout mouse model displaying <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark> activation.
RESULTS: UM-SCC showed increased <mark>PIK3CA</mark> expression and <mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark> activation, and PF-502 inhibited <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>mTORC1/2</mark> targets.
In human HNSCC expressing <mark>PIK3CA</mark> and decreased wt<mark>TP53</mark> and <mark>p73</mark>, PF-502 reciprocally enhanced <mark>TP53</mark>/<mark>p73</mark> expression and growth inhibition, which was partially reversible by <mark>p53</mark> inhibitor pifithrin-alpha.
Most UM-SCC with wt<mark>TP53</mark> exhibited a lower IC50 than those with mt<mark>TP53</mark> status.
PF-502 blocked growth in G0-G1 and increased apoptotic sub-G0 DNA.
PF-502 suppressed tumorigenesis and showed combinatorial activity with radiation in a wild-type <mark>TP53</mark> UM-SCC xenograft model.
PF-502 also significantly delayed HNSCC tumorigenesis and prolonged survival of <mark>Pten</mark>/<mark>Tgfbr1</mark>-deficient mice.
Significant inhibition of p-<mark>Akt</mark>, p-<mark>4EBP1</mark>, p-<mark>S6</mark>, and <mark>Ki67</mark>, as well as increased <mark>p53</mark> and TUNEL were observed in tumor specimens.
CONCLUSIONS: <mark>PI3K</mark>-<mark>mTOR</mark> inhibition can enhance <mark>TP53</mark>/<mark>p73</mark> expression and significantly inhibit tumor growth alone or when combined with radiation in HNSCC with wild-type <mark>TP53</mark>.
<mark>PIK3CA</mark>, <mark>TP53</mark>/<mark>p73</mark>, <mark>PTEN</mark>, and <mark>TGF-beta</mark> alterations are potential modifiers of response and merit investigation in future clinical trials with <mark>PI3K</mark>-<mark>mTOR</mark> inhibitors.
Upregulation of <mark>T-cell factor-4</mark> isoform-responsive target genes in hepatocellular carcinoma.
BACKGROUND: The <mark>Wnt</mark>/<mark>beta-catenin</mark> signalling pathway regulates genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, migration and invasion through regulation by <mark>T-cell factor (TCF)-4 transcription factor</mark> proteins.
However, the role of <mark>TCF-4</mark> isoforms generated by alternative splicing events in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown.
AIM: Here, we investigated <mark>TCF-4</mark> isoforms (<mark>TCF-4J and K</mark>)-responsive target genes that are important in hepatic oncogenesis and tumour development.
METHODS: Gene expression microarray was performed on HCC cells overexpressing <mark>TCF-4J and K</mark> isoforms.
Expression level of selected target genes was evaluated and correlations were made between their expression level and that of <mark>TCF-4</mark> isoform in 47 pairs of human HCC tumours.
RESULTS: Comparison by gene expression microarray revealed that 447 genes were upregulated and 343 downregulated more than 2.0-fold in <mark>TCF-4J</mark> compared with <mark>TCF-4K</mark> expressing cells.
We validated expression of 18 selected target genes involved in <mark>Wnt</mark>/<mark>beta-catenin</mark>, <mark>insulin</mark>/<mark>IGF-1</mark>/<mark>IRS1</mark> and <mark>Notch</mark> signalling pathways in 47 pairs of human HCCs and adjacent uninvolved liver tissues.
It was observed that 13 genes (<mark>CLDN2</mark>, <mark>STK17B</mark>, <mark>SPP1</mark>, <mark>AXIN2</mark>, <mark>WISP2</mark>, <mark>MMP7</mark>, <mark>IRS1</mark>, <mark>ANXA1</mark>, <mark>CAMK2N1</mark>, <mark>ASPH</mark>, <mark>GPR56</mark>, <mark>CD24</mark> and <mark>JAG1</mark>) activated by <mark>TCF-4J</mark> isoform in HCC cells, were also upregulated in HCC tumours compared with adjacent peritumour tissue; more importantly, 10 genes exhibited a significant correlation with the <mark>TCF-4J</mark> expression level in tumour.
CONCLUSION: <mark>TCF-4</mark> isoforms (<mark>TCF-4J and K</mark>) activated different downstream target genes in HCC.
The biological consequence of <mark>TCF-4J</mark> isoform expression was upregulation of genes associated with tripartite <mark>Wnt</mark>/<mark>beta-catenin</mark>, <mark>insulin</mark>/<mark>IGF-1</mark>/<mark>IRS1</mark> and <mark>Notch</mark> signal transduction pathway activation, which contribute to the pathogenesis of HCC.
<mark>Telomerase</mark> downregulation induces proapoptotic genes expression and initializes breast cancer cells apoptosis followed by DNA fragmentation in a cell type dependent manner.
The aim of the study was to analyze the consequence of silencing genes coding for the key subunits of the <mark>telomerase complex</mark>, i.e. <mark>TERT</mark>, <mark>TERC</mark> and <mark>TP1</mark> in human breast cancer MCF7 and MDA-MB-231cells.
The transfection was performed using Lipofectamine2000 and pooled siRNAs.
The cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative effect of siRNA was measured by the SRB assay, the cell cycle was analysed by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation by TUNEL analysis.
<mark>Telomerase</mark> activity was assessed by TRAP, followed by PAGE and ELISA assays.
<mark>Telomerase</mark> downregulation was also assessed using qPCR in order to estimate the changes in the expression profile of genes engaged in apoptosis.
It was revealed that treatment of breast cancer cells with different siRNAs (100 nM) resulted in a cell type and time-dependent effects.
The downregulation of <mark>telomerase</mark> subunits was followed by reduction of <mark>telomerase</mark> activity down to almost 60% compared to control cells.
However, a significant effect was only observed when the <mark>TERT</mark> subunit was downregulated.
Its silencing resulted in a significant (p<0.05) increase of apoptosis (over 10% in MCF7 and about 5% in MDA-MB-231 cells, corresponding to the <mark>Annexin V</mark> assay) and DNA fragmentation (almost 30% in MCF7 and over 25% in MDA-MB-231 cells).
Interestingly, also several proapoptotic genes were induced after the downregulation of the key <mark>telomerase</mark> subunit, including <mark>Bax</mark>, <mark>Bik</mark> or <mark>caspase-1</mark> and <mark>caspase-14</mark>, as well as <mark>NGFR</mark> and <mark>TNFSF10</mark> which were upregulated twice and more.
Arabidopsis <mark>CHROMOSOME TRANSMISSION FIDELITY 7</mark> (<mark>AtCTF7</mark>/<mark>ECO1</mark>) is required for DNA repair, mitosis and meiosis.
The proper transmission of DNA in dividing cells is crucial for the survival of eukaryotic organisms.
During cell division, faithful segregation of replicated chromosomes requires their tight attachment, known as sister chromatid cohesion, until anaphase.
Sister chromatid cohesion is established during S-phase in a process requiring an <mark>acetyltransferase</mark> that in yeast is known as <mark>Establishment of cohesion 1</mark> (<mark>Eco1</mark>).
Inactivation of <mark>Eco1</mark> typically disrupts chromosome segregation and homologous recombination-dependent DNA repair in dividing cells, ultimately resulting in lethality.
We report here the isolation and detailed characterization of two homozygous T-DNA insertion mutants for the Arabidopsis thaliana <mark>Eco1</mark> homolog, <mark>CHROMOSOME TRANSMISSION FIDELITY 7/ESTABLISHMENT OF COHESION 1</mark> (<mark>CTF7</mark>/<mark>ECO1</mark>), called <mark>ctf7</mark>-1 and <mark>ctf7</mark>-2.
Mutants exhibited dwarfism, poor anther development and sterility.
Analysis of somatic tissues by flow cytometry, scanning electron microscopy and quantitative real-time PCR identified defects in DNA repair and cell division, including an increase in the area of leaf epidermal cells, an increase in DNA content and the upregulation of genes involved in DNA repair including <mark>BRCA1</mark> and <mark>PARP2</mark>.
No significant change was observed in the expression of genes that influence entry into the endocycle.
Analysis of meiocytes identified changes in chromosome morphology and defective segregation; the abundance of chromosomal-bound cohesion subunits was also reduced.
Transcript levels for several meiotic genes, including the recombinase genes <mark>DMC1</mark> and <mark>RAD51C</mark> and the S-phase licensing factor <mark>CDC45</mark> were elevated in mutant anthers.
Taken together our results demonstrate that Arabidopsis <mark>CTF7</mark>/<mark>ECO1</mark> plays important roles in the preservation of genome integrity and meiosis.
<mark>AP4</mark> is a mediator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis in colorectal cancer.
The <mark>basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor</mark> <mark>AP4</mark>/<mark>TFAP4</mark>/<mark>AP-4</mark> is encoded by a <mark>c-MYC</mark> target gene and displays up-regulation concomitantly with <mark>c-MYC</mark> in colorectal cancer (CRC) and numerous other tumor types.
Here a genome-wide characterization of <mark>AP4</mark> DNA binding and mRNA expression was performed using a combination of microarray, genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation, next-generation sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses.
Thereby, hundreds of induced and repressed <mark>AP4</mark> target genes were identified.
Besides many genes involved in the control of proliferation, the <mark>AP4</mark> target genes included markers of stemness (<mark>LGR5</mark> and <mark>CD44</mark>) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) such as <mark>SNAIL</mark>, <mark>E-cadherin</mark>/<mark>CDH1</mark>, <mark>OCLN</mark>, <mark>VIM</mark>, <mark>FN1</mark>, and the <mark>Claudins 1, 4, and 7</mark>.
Accordingly, activation of <mark>AP4</mark> induced EMT and enhanced migration and invasion of CRC cells.
Conversely, down-regulation of <mark>AP4</mark> resulted in mesenchymal-epithelial transition and inhibited migration and invasion.
In addition, <mark>AP4</mark> induction was required for EMT, migration, and invasion caused by ectopic expression of <mark>c-MYC</mark>.
Inhibition of <mark>AP4</mark> in CRC cells resulted in decreased lung metastasis in mice.
Elevated <mark>AP4</mark> expression in primary CRC significantly correlated with liver metastasis and poor patient survival.
These findings imply <mark>AP4</mark> as a new regulator of EMT that contributes to metastatic processes in CRC and presumably other carcinomas.
The eta7/<mark>csn3</mark>-3 auxin response mutant of Arabidopsis defines a novel function for the <mark>CSN3</mark> subunit of the <mark>COP9</mark> signalosome.
The <mark>COP9</mark> signalosome (<mark>CSN</mark>) is an eight subunit protein complex conserved in all higher eukaryotes.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, the <mark>CSN</mark> regulates auxin response by removing the <mark>ubiquitin-like protein</mark> <mark>NEDD8</mark>/<mark>RUB1</mark> from the <mark>CUL1</mark> subunit of the <mark>SCF(TIR1/AFB) ubiquitin-ligase</mark> (deneddylation).
Previously described null mutations in any <mark>CSN</mark> subunit result in the pleiotropic cop/det/fus phenotype and cause seedling lethality, hampering the study of <mark>CSN</mark> functions in plant development.
In a genetic screen to identify enhancers of the auxin response defects conferred by the <mark>tir1</mark>-1 mutation, we identified a viable <mark>csn</mark> mutant of subunit 3 (<mark>CSN3</mark>), designated eta7/<mark>csn3</mark>-3.
In addition to enhancing <mark>tir1</mark>-1 mutant phenotypes, the <mark>csn3</mark>-3 mutation alone confers several phenotypes indicative of impaired auxin signaling including auxin resistant root growth and diminished auxin responsive gene expression.
Unexpectedly however, <mark>csn3</mark>-3 plants are not defective in either the <mark>CSN</mark>-mediated deneddylation of <mark>CUL1</mark> or in SCF(<mark>TIR1</mark>)-mediated degradation of Aux/IAA proteins.
These findings suggest that <mark>csn3</mark>-3 is an atypical <mark>csn</mark> mutant that defines a novel <mark>CSN</mark> or <mark>CSN3</mark>-specific function.
Consistent with this possibility, we observe dramatic differences in double mutant interactions between <mark>csn3</mark>-3 and other auxin signaling mutants compared to another weak <mark>csn</mark> mutant, <mark>csn1</mark>-10.
Lastly, unlike other <mark>csn</mark> mutants, assembly of the <mark>CSN</mark> holocomplex is unaffected in <mark>csn3</mark>-3 plants.
However, we detected a small <mark>CSN3</mark>-containing protein complex that is altered in <mark>csn3</mark>-3 plants.
We hypothesize that in addition to its role in the <mark>CSN</mark> as a <mark>cullin deneddylase</mark>, <mark>CSN3</mark> functions in a distinct protein complex that is required for proper auxin signaling.
<mark>Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 (NF-E2) p45-related factor-2</mark> (<mark>Nrf2</mark>) modulates dendritic cell immune function through regulation of <mark>p38 MAPK</mark>-<mark>cAMP-responsive element binding protein</mark>/<mark>activating transcription factor 1</mark> signaling.
<mark>Nrf2</mark> is a redox-responsive <mark>transcription factor</mark> that has been implicated in the regulation of DC immune function.
Loss of <mark>Nrf2</mark> results in increased co-stimulatory molecule expression, enhanced T cell stimulatory capacity, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in murine immature DCs (iDCs).
It is unknown whether altered immune function of <mark>Nrf2</mark>-deficient DCs (<mark>Nrf2</mark>(-/-) iDCs) is due to elevated ROS levels.
Furthermore, it is unclear which intracellular signaling pathways are involved in <mark>Nrf2</mark>-mediated regulation of DC function.
Using antioxidant vitamins to reset ROS levels in <mark>Nrf2</mark>(-/-) iDCs, we show that elevated ROS is not responsible for the altered phenotype and function of these DCs.
Pharmacological inhibitors were used to explore the role of key <mark>MAPKs</mark> in mediating the altered phenotype and function in <mark>Nrf2</mark>(-/-) iDCs.
We demonstrate that the increased co-stimulatory molecule expression (<mark>MHC II</mark> and <mark>CD86</mark>) and antigen-specific T cell activation capacity observed in <mark>Nrf2</mark>(-/-) iDCs was reversed by inhibition of <mark>p38 MAPK</mark> but not <mark>JNK</mark>.
Importantly, we provide evidence for increased phosphorylation of <mark>cAMP-responsive element binding protein</mark> (<mark>CREB</mark>) and <mark>activating transcription factor 1</mark> (<mark>ATF1</mark>), <mark>transcription factors</mark> that are downstream of <mark>p38 MAPK</mark>.
The increased phosphorylation of <mark>CREB</mark>/<mark>ATF1</mark> in <mark>Nrf2</mark>(-/-) iDCs was sensitive to <mark>p38 MAPK</mark> inhibition.
We also show data to implicate <mark>heme oxygenase-1</mark> as a potential molecular link between <mark>Nrf2</mark> and <mark>CREB</mark>/<mark>ATF1</mark>.
These results indicate that dysregulation of <mark>p38 MAPK</mark>-<mark>CREB</mark>/<mark>ATF1</mark> signaling axis underlies the altered function and phenotype in <mark>Nrf2</mark>-deficient DCs.
Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which <mark>Nrf2</mark> mediates regulation of DC function.
<mark>Superoxide dismutase 1</mark> overexpression in mice abolishes maternal diabetes-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress in diabetic embryopathy.
OBJECTIVE: Both oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) are causal events in diabetic embryopathy.
We tested whether oxidative stress causes ER stress.
STUDY DESIGN: Wild-type (WT) and <mark>superoxide dismutase 1</mark> (<mark>SOD1</mark>)-overexpressing day 8.75 embryos from nondiabetic WT control with <mark>SOD1</mark> transgenic male and diabetic WT female with <mark>SOD1</mark> transgenic male were analyzed for ER stress markers: <mark>C/EBP-homologous protein</mark> (<mark>CHOP</mark>), <mark>calnexin</mark>, <mark>eukaryotic initiation factor 2α</mark> (<mark>eIF2α</mark>), <mark>protein kinase ribonucleic acid (RNA)-like ER kinase</mark> (<mark>PERK</mark>), <mark>binding immunog<mark>immunoglobulin</mark>n</mark>, <mark>protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3</mark>, <mark>kinases inositol-requiring protein-1α</mark> (<mark>IRE1α</mark>), and the <mark>X-box binding protein</mark> (<mark>XBP1</mark>) messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing.
RESULTS: Maternal diabetes significantly increased the levels of <mark>CHOP</mark>, <mark>calnexin</mark>, phosphorylated (p)-<mark>eIF2α</mark>, p-<mark>PERK</mark>, and p-<mark>IRE1α</mark>; triggered <mark>XBP1</mark> mRNA splicing; and enhanced ER chaperone gene expression in WT embryos.
<mark>SOD1</mark> overexpression blocked these diabetes-induced ER stress markers.
CONCLUSION: Mitigating oxidative stress via <mark>SOD1</mark> overexpression blocks maternal diabetes-induced ER stress in vivo.
<mark>Tcf19</mark> is a novel islet factor necessary for proliferation and survival in the INS-1 β-cell line.
Recently, a novel type 1 diabetes association locus was identified at human chromosome 6p31.3, and <mark>transcription factor 19</mark> (<mark>TCF19</mark>) is a likely causal gene.
Little is known about <mark>Tcf19</mark>, and we now show that it plays a role in both proliferation and apoptosis in insulinoma cells.
<mark>Tcf19</mark> is expressed in mouse and human islets, with increasing mRNA expression in nondiabetic obesity.
The expression of <mark>Tcf19</mark> is correlated with β-cell mass expansion, suggesting that it may be a transcriptional regulator of β-cell mass.
Increasing proliferation and decreasing apoptotic cell death are two strategies to increase pancreatic β-cell mass and prevent or delay diabetes.
siRNA-mediated knockdown of <mark>Tcf19</mark> in the INS-1 insulinoma cell line, a β-cell model, results in a decrease in proliferation and an increase in apoptosis.
There was a significant reduction in the expression of numerous cell cycle genes from the late G1 phase through the M phase, and cells were arrested at the G1/S checkpoint.
We also observed increased apoptosis and susceptibility to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress after <mark>Tcf19</mark> knockdown.
There was a reduction in expression of genes important for the maintenance of ER homeostasis (<mark>Bip</mark>, <mark>p58(IPK<mark>p58</mark>m<mark>IPK</mark>>, <mark>Edem1</mark>, and <mark>calreticulin</mark>) and an increase in proapoptotic genes (<mark>Bim</mark>, <mark>Bid</mark>, <mark>Nix</mark>, <mark>Gadd34</mark>, and <mark>Pdia2</mark>).
Therefore, <mark>Tcf19</mark> is necessary for both proliferation and survival and is a novel regulator of these pathways.
Loss of <mark>PPARg</mark> expression in mammary secretory epithelial cells creates a pro-breast tumorigenic environment.
Breast cancer is the leading cause of new cancer diagnoses among women.
Using <mark>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ</mark>((+/-)) mice, we showed normal expression of <mark>PPARg</mark> was critical to stop 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced breast tumorigenesis.
<mark>PPARg</mark> is expressed in many breast cell types including mammary secretory epithelial (MSE) cells.
MSEs proliferate as required during pregnancy, and undergo apoptosis or reversible transdifferentiation during involution once lactation is complete.
Thus, MSE-specific loss of <mark>PPARγ</mark> was hypothesized to enhance DMBA-mediated breast tumorigenesis.
To test this, MSE cell-specific <mark>PPARγ</mark> knockout (<mark>PPARg</mark>-MSE KO) and control (<mark>PPARγ</mark>-WT) mice were generated, mated and allowed to nurse for three days.
One week after involution, dams were treated with DMBA to initiate breast tumors, and randomized on week 7 to continue receiving a normal chow diet (DMBA Only: <mark>PPARγ</mark>-WT, n = 15; <mark>PPARγ</mark>-MSE KO, n = 25) or one supplemented with a <mark>PPARγ</mark> activating drug (DMBA + ROSI: <mark>PPARg</mark>-WT, n = 17; <mark>PPARγ</mark>-MSE KO, n = 24), and monitored for changes in breast tumor outcomes.
<mark>PPARg</mark>-MSE KOs had significantly lower overall survival and decreased mammary tumor latency as compared to <mark>PPARg</mark>-WT controls.
<mark>PPARg</mark> activation significantly reduced DMBA-mediated malignant mammary tumor volumes irrespective of genotype.
MSE-specific <mark>PPARg</mark> loss resulted in decreased mammary gland expression of <mark>PTEN</mark> and <mark>Bax</mark>, increased superoxide anion production, and elevated serum <mark>eotaxin</mark> and <mark>RANTES</mark>, creating a protumorigenic environment.
Moreover, <mark>PPARg</mark> activation in MSEs delayed mammary tumor growth in part by down-regulating <mark>Cox-1</mark>, <mark>Cox-2</mark> and <mark>cyclin D1</mark>.
Collectively, these studies highlight a protective role of MSE-specific <mark>PPARg</mark> during breast tumorigenesis, and support a novel chemotherapeutic role of <mark>PPARγ</mark> activation in breast cancer.
Activation of <mark>MAPK</mark> pathways due to <mark>DUSP4</mark> loss promotes cancer stem cell-like phenotypes in basal-like breast cancer.
Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is an aggressive disease that lacks a clinically approved targeted therapy.
Traditional chemotherapy is effective in BLBC, but it spares the cancer stem cell (CSC)-like population, which is likely to contribute to cancer recurrence after the initial treatment.
<mark>Dual specificity phosphatase-4</mark> (<mark>DUSP4</mark>) is a negative regulator of the <mark>mitogen-activated protein kinase</mark> (<mark>MAPK</mark>) pathway that is deficient in highly aggressive BLBCs treated with chemotherapy, leading to aberrant <mark>MAPK</mark> activation and resistance to taxane-induced apoptosis.
Herein, we investigated how <mark>DUSP4</mark> regulates the <mark>MAP-ERK kinase</mark> (<mark>MEK</mark>) and <mark>c-jun-NH2-kinase</mark> (<mark>JNK</mark>) pathways in modifying CSC-like behavior.
<mark>DUSP4</mark> loss increased mammosphere formation and the expression of the CSC-promoting <mark>cytokines</mark> <mark>interleukin (IL)-6</mark> and <mark>IL-8</mark>.
These effects were caused in part by loss of control of the <mark>MEK</mark> and <mark>JNK</mark> pathways and involved downstream activation of the <mark>ETS-1</mark> and <mark>c-JUN</mark> transcription factors.
Enforced expression of <mark>DUSP4</mark> reduced the <mark>CD44</mark>(+)/<mark>CD24</mark>(-) population in multiple BLBC cell lines in a <mark>MEK</mark>-dependent manner, limiting tumor formation of <mark>claudin</mark>-low SUM159PT cells in mice.
Our findings support the evaluation of <mark>MEK</mark> and <mark>JNK</mark> pathway inhibitors as therapeutic agents in BLBC to eliminate the CSC population.
Downregulation of <mark>steroid receptor coactivator-2</mark> modulates estrogen-responsive genes and stimulates proliferation of mcf-7 breast cancer cells.
The <mark>p160</mark>/<mark>Steroid Receptor Coactivators</mark> <mark>SRC-1</mark>, <mark>SRC-2</mark>/<mark>GRIP1</mark>, and <mark>SRC-3</mark>/<mark>AIB1</mark> are important regulators of <mark>Estrogen Receptor alpha</mark> (<mark>ERalpha</mark>) activity.
However, whereas the functions of <mark>SRC-1</mark> and <mark>SRC-3</mark> in breast tumourigenesis have been extensively studied, little is known about the role of <mark>SRC-2</mark>.
Previously, we reported that activation of the <mark>cAMP-dependent protein kinase</mark>, <mark>PKA</mark>, facilitates ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of <mark>SRC-2</mark> which in turn leads to inhibition of <mark>SRC-2</mark>-coactivation of <mark>ERalpha</mark> and changed expression of the <mark>ERalpha</mark> target gene, <mark>pS2</mark>.
Here we have characterized the global program of transcription in <mark>SRC-2</mark>-depleted MCF-7 breast cancer cells using short-hairpin RNA technology, and in MCF-7 cells exposed to <mark>PKA</mark> activating agents.
In order to identify genes that may be regulated through <mark>PKA</mark>-induced downregulation of <mark>SRC-2</mark>, overlapping transcriptional targets in response to the respective treatments were characterized.
Interestingly, we observed decreased expression of several breast cancer <mark>tumour suppressor genes</mark> (e.g., <mark>TAGLN</mark>, <mark>EGR1</mark>, <mark>BCL11b</mark>, <mark>CAV1</mark>) in response to both <mark>SRC-2</mark> knockdown and <mark>PKA</mark> activation, whereas the expression of a number of other genes implicated in cancer progression (e.g., <mark>RET</mark>, <mark>BCAS1</mark>, <mark>TFF3</mark>, <mark>CXCR4</mark>, <mark>ADM</mark>) was increased.
In line with this, knockdown of <mark>SRC-2</mark> also stimulated proliferation of MCF-7 cells.
Together, these results suggest that <mark>SRC-2</mark> may have an antiproliferative function in breast cancer cells.
Mammary carcinoma cell derived <mark>cyclooxygenase 2</mark> suppresses tumor immune surveillance by enhancing intratumoral immune checkpoint activity.
INTRODUCTION: Systemic inhibition of the inflammatory enzyme <mark>cyclooxygenase (COX) 2</mark> decreases the risk of breast cancer and its recurrence.
However, the biology of <mark>COX-2</mark> in the multicellular tumor microenvironment is poorly defined.
METHODS: Mammary tumor onset and multiplicity were examined in <mark>ErbB2</mark> transgenic mice that were deficient in mammary epithelial cell <mark>COX-2</mark> (<mark>COX-2</mark>(MEC)KO) compared to wild type (WT) mice.
Tumors were analyzed, by real time PCR, immune-staining and flow cytometry, for proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and immune microenvironment.
Lentiviral shRNA delivery was used to knock down (KD) <mark>COX-2</mark> in <mark>ErbB2</mark>-transformed mouse breast cancer cells (<mark>COX-2</mark>KD), and growth as orthotopic tumors was examined in syngenic recipient mice, with or without depletion of <mark>CD8</mark>+ immune cells.
RESULTS: Mammary tumor onset was delayed, and multiplicity halved, in <mark>COX-2</mark>(MEC)KO mice compared to WT.
<mark>COX-2</mark>(MEC)KO tumors showed decreased expression of <mark>Ki67</mark>, a proliferation marker, as well as reduced <mark>VEGFA</mark>, its receptor <mark>VEGFR2</mark>, <mark>endothelial NOS</mark> and the vascular endothelial marker <mark>CD31</mark>, indicating reduced tumor vascularization.
<mark>COX-2</mark>(MEC)KO tumors contained more <mark>CD4</mark>+ T helper (Th) cells and <mark>CD8</mark>+ cytotoxic immune cells (CTL) consistent with increased immune surveillance.
The ratio of Th markers <mark>Tbet</mark> (Th1) to <mark>GATA3</mark> (Th2) was higher, and levels of <mark>Retnla</mark>, a M2 macrophage marker, lower, in <mark>COX-2</mark>(MEC)KO tumor infiltrating leukocytes compared to WT, suggesting a prevalence of pro-immune Th1 over immune suppressive Th2 lymphocytes, and reduced macrophage polarization to the immune suppressive M2 phenotype.
Enhanced immune surveillance in <mark>COX-2</mark>(MEC)KO tumors was coincident with increased intratumoral <mark>CXCL9</mark>, a T cell chemoattractant, and decreased expression of <mark>T lymphocyte co-inhibitory receptors</mark> <mark>CTLA4</mark> and <mark>PD-1</mark>, as well as <mark>PD-L1</mark>, the ligand for <mark>PD-1</mark>.
<mark>PD-L1</mark> was also decreased in <mark>IFNgamma</mark>-treated <mark>COX-2</mark>KD mouse mammary cancer cells in vitro and, compared to control cells, growth of <mark>COX-2</mark>KD cells as orthotopic tumors in immune competent mice was markedly suppressed.
However, robust growth of <mark>COX-2</mark>KD tumor cells was evident when recipients were depleted of <mark>CD8</mark>+ cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The data strongly support that, in addition to its angiogenic function, tumor cell <mark>COX-2</mark> suppresses intratumoral cytotoxic <mark>CD8</mark>+ immune cell function, possibly through upregulation of immune checkpoints, thereby contributing to tumor immune escape.
<mark>COX-2</mark> inhibition may be clinically useful to augment breast cancer immunotherapy.
<mark>CTR9</mark>/<mark>PAF1c</mark> regulates molecular lineage identity, <mark>histone H3K36</mark> trimethylation and genomic imprinting during preimplantation development.
Genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming is required for successful preimplantation development.
Inappropriate or deficient chromatin regulation can result in defective lineage specification and loss of genomic imprinting, compromising normal development.
Here we report that two members of the <mark>RNA polymerase II associated factor, homolog (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) complex</mark> (<mark>PAF1 co<mark>PAF1</mark>x</mark>) components, <mark>Ctr9</mark> and <mark>Rtf1</mark>, are required during mammalian preimplantation development.
We demonstrate that <mark>Ctr9</mark>-deficient embryos fail to correctly specify lineages at the blastocyst stage.
Expression of some lineage specific factors is markedly reduced in <mark>Ctr9</mark> knockdown embryos, including <mark>Eomes</mark>, <mark>Elf5</mark> and <mark>Sox2</mark>, while others are inappropriately expressed (<mark>Oct4</mark>, <mark>Nanog</mark>, <mark>Gata6</mark>, <mark>Fgf4</mark> and <mark>Sox17</mark>).
We also show that several imprinted genes (<mark>Mest</mark>, <mark>Peg3</mark>, <mark>Snrpn</mark> and <mark>Meg3</mark>) are aberrantly expressed although allele specific DNA methylation is not altered.
We document a loss of <mark>histone H3</mark> lysine 36 trimethylation (<mark>H3K36</mark>me3) in <mark>Ctr9</mark>-deficient embryos and confirm that knockdown of either <mark>Setd2</mark> or <mark>Rtf1</mark> results in similar phenotypes.
These findings show that the <mark>PAF1</m<mark>PAF1 complex</mark> is required for mammalian development, likely through regulation of <mark>H3K36</mark>me3, and indicate functional conservation of the <mark>PAF1</m<mark>PAF1 complex</mark> from yeast to mammals in vivo.
Common polymorphism (81Val>Ile) and rare mutations (257Arg>Ser and 335Ile>Ser) of the <mark>MC3R</mark> gene in obese Polish children and adolescents.
The predisposing role to human obesity of the <mark>MC3R</mark> gene polymorphism is controversial.
In this report we present the first study focused on the search for the <mark>MC3R</mark> polymorphism in the Polish population.
Altogether 257 obese children and adolescents (RBMI>120) and 94 adults, who were never obese or overweight (BMI<25), were studied.
For all subjects the entire coding sequence was analyzed by direct DNA sequencing.
One common polymorphism (81Val>Ile) and two rare mutations (257Arg>Ser and 335Ile>Ser) were identified.
The common polymorphism was widely distributed in the obese and control cohorts, while the mutations were identified in four obese subjects only.
In case of the 335Ile>Ser substitution a three-generation family, consisting of 20 members, was also analyzed.
It was found that all carriers of the 335Ser mutation were obese, but among non-carriers obese subjects also were found.
Our study suggests that the predisposing effect to obesity of the 81Ile polymorphic variant is rather unlikely.
With regard to the studied rare mutations we suggest that the 335Ser allele may have a small predisposing effect.
Mechanical ventilation enhances <mark>HMGB1</mark> expression in an LPS-induced lung injury model.
BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation (MV) can augment inflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenged lungs.
<mark>High mobility group box 1</mark> protein (<mark>HMGB1</mark>) is a pro-inflammatory mediator in ventilator-induced lung injury, but its mechanisms are not well defined.
This study investigated the role of <mark>HMGB1</mark> in lung inflammation in response to the combination of MV and LPS treatment.
METHODS: Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to one of four groups: sham control; LPS treatment; mechanical ventilation; mechanical ventilation with LPS treatment.
Mechanically ventilated animals received 10 ml/kg tidal volumes at a rate of 40 breaths/min for 4 h. In the <mark>HMGB1</mark>-blockade study, sixteen rats were randomly assigned to <mark>HMGB1</mark> antibody group or control antibody group and animals were subjected to MV+LPS as described above.
A549 cells were pre-incubated with different signal inhibitors before subjected to 4 h of cyclic stretch.
Lung wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio, total protein and IgG concentration, number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lung histological changes were examined.
The levels of <mark>interleukin-1β</mark> (<mark>IL-1β</mark>), <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>tumor necrosis factor-α</mark> (<mark>TNF-α</mark>), <mark>macrophage inflammatory protein-2</mark> (<mark>MIP-2</mark>) and <mark>HMGB1</mark> in BALF were measured using ELISA.
Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot were used to analyze mRNA and protein expression of <mark>HMGB1</mark>.
Western blot were employed to analyze the activation of <mark>IκB-α</mark>, <mark>NF-κB</mark>, <mark>JNK</mark>, <mark>ERK</mark>, and <mark>p38</mark>.
RESULTS: MV significantly augmented LPS-induced lung injury and <mark>HMGB1</mark> expression, which was correlated with the increase in <mark>IL-1β</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark> and <mark>MIP-2</mark> levels in BALF.
In vivo, intratracheally administration of <mark>HMGB1</mark> antibody significantly attenuated pulmonary inflammatory injury.
In vitro experiments showed cyclic stretch induced <mark>HMGB1</mark> expression through signaling pathways including <mark>p38</mark> and <mark>NF-κB</mark>.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicated that moderate tidal volume MV augmented LPS induced lung injury by up-regulating <mark>HMGB1</mark>.
The mechanism of <mark>HMGB1</mark>-mediated lung injury is likely to be signaling through <mark>p38</mark> and <mark>NF-κB</mark> pathways.
Identification and characterization of <mark>FGF2</mark>-dependent mRNA: <mark>microRNA</mark> networks during lens fiber cell differentiation.
<mark>MicroRNAs</mark> (<mark>miRNAs</mark>) and fibroblast growth factor (<mark>FGF</mark>) signaling regulate a wide range of cellular functions, including cell specification, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival.
In lens, both these systems control lens fiber cell differentiation; however, a possible link between these processes remains to be examined.
Herein, the functional requirement for <mark>miRNAs</mark> in differentiating lens fiber cells was demonstrated via conditional inactivation of <mark>Dicer1</mark> in mouse (Mus musculus) lens.
To dissect the <mark>miRNA</mark>-dependent pathways during lens differentiation, we used a rat (Rattus norvegicus) lens epithelial explant system, induced by <mark>FGF2</mark> to differentiate, followed by mRNA and <mark>miRNA</mark> expression profiling.
Transcriptome and miRNome analysis identified extensive <mark>FGF2</mark>-regulated cellular responses that were both independent and dependent on <mark>miRNAs</mark>.
We identified 131 <mark>FGF2</mark>-regulated miRNAs.
Seventy-six of these <mark>miRNAs</mark> had at least two in silico predicted and inversely regulated target mRNAs.
Genes modulated by the greatest number of <mark>FGF</mark>-regulated <mark>miRNAs</mark> include DNA-binding <mark>transcription factors</mark> <mark>Nfib</mark>, <mark>Nfat5</mark>/<mark>OREBP</mark>, <mark>c-Maf</mark>, <mark>Ets1</mark>, and <mark>N-Myc</mark>.
Activated <mark>FGF</mark> signaling influenced <mark>bone morphogenetic factor</mark>/<mark>transforming growth factor-beta</mark>, <mark>Notch</mark>, and <mark>Wnt</mark> signaling cascades implicated earlier in lens differentiation.
Specific <mark>miRNA</mark>:mRNA interaction networks were predicted for <mark>c-Maf</mark>, <mark>N-Myc</mark>, and <mark>Nfib</mark> (DNA-binding <mark>transcription factors</mark>); <mark>Cnot6</mark>, <mark>Cpsf6</mark>, <mark>Dicer1</mark>, and <mark>Tnrc6b</mark> (RNA to <mark>miRNA</mark> processing); and <mark>Ash1l</mark>, <mark>Med1</mark>/<mark>PBP</mark>, and <mark>Kdm5b</mark>/<mark>Jarid1b</mark>/<mark>Plu1</mark> (chromatin remodeling).
Three <mark>miRNAs</mark>, including <mark>miR-143</mark>, <mark>miR-155</mark>, and <mark>miR-301a</mark>, down-regulated expression of <mark>c-Maf</mark> in the 3'-UTR <mark>luciferase</mark> reporter assays.
These present studies demonstrate for the first time global impact of activated <mark>FGF</mark> signaling in lens cell culture system and predicted novel gene regulatory networks connected by multiple <mark>miRNAs</mark> that regulate lens differentiation.
<mark>STAT3</mark> regulates proliferation and survival of <mark>CD8</mark>+ T cells: enhances effector responses to HSV-1 infection, and inhibits <mark>IL-10</mark>+ regulatory <mark>CD8</mark>+ T cells in autoimmune uveitis.
<mark>STAT3</mark> regulates <mark>CD4</mark>+ T cell survival and differentiation.
However, its effects on <mark>CD8</mark>+ T cells are not well understood.
Here, we show that in comparison to WT <mark>CD8</mark>+ T cells, <mark>STAT3</mark>-deficient <mark>CD8</mark>+ T cells exhibit a preactivated memory-like phenotype, produce more <mark>IL-2</mark>, proliferate faster, and are more sensitive to activation-induced cell death (AICD).
The enhanced proliferation and sensitivity to AICD correlated with downregulation of <mark>class-O forkhead transcription factors</mark> (<mark>FoxO1</mark>, <mark>FoxO3A</mark>), <mark>p21</mark>(<mark>waf1</mark>), <mark>p27(KIP1)</mark>, <mark>Bcl-2</mark>, <mark>OX-40</mark>, and upregulation of <mark>FasL</mark>, <mark>Bax</mark>, and <mark>Bad</mark>.
We examined whether <mark>STAT3</mark>-deficient <mark>CD8</mark>+ T cells can mount effective response during herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) infection and experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU).
Compared to WT mice, HSV-1-infected <mark>STAT3</mark>-deficient mice (<mark>STAT3</mark>KO) produced less <mark>IFN-gamma</mark> and virus-specific <mark>KLRG-1</mark>+ <mark>CD8</mark>+ T cells.
<mark>STAT3</mark>KO mice are also resistant to EAU and produced less <mark>IL-17</mark>-producing Tc17 cells.
Resistance of <mark>STAT3</mark>KO to EAU correlated with marked expansion of <mark>IL-10</mark>-producing regulatory <mark>CD8</mark>+ T cells (<mark>CD8</mark>-Treg) implicated in recovery from autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
Thus, increases of <mark>IL-6</mark>-induced <mark>STAT3</mark> activation observed during inflammation may inhibit expansion of <mark>CD8</mark>-Tregs, thereby impeding recovery from uveitis.
These results suggest that <mark>STAT3</mark> is a potential therapeutic target for upregulating <mark>CD8</mark>+ T cell-mediated responses to viruses and suggest the successful therapeutic targeting of <mark>STAT3</mark> as treatment for uveitis, derived, in part, from promoting <mark>CD8</mark>-Treg expansion.
Protective roles of <mark>interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3</mark> (<mark>IFIT3</mark>) in dengue virus infection of human lung epithelial cells.
<mark>Interferons</mark> (<mark>IFNs</mark>) are critical <mark>cytokines</mark> that regulate immune response against virus infections.
Dengue virus (DV) infections are a major public health concern worldwide, and especially in Asia.
In the present study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of action of <mark>IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3</mark> (<mark>IFIT3</mark>) in human lung epithelial cells.
The results demonstrated that DV infection induced expression of several <mark>IFITs</mark>, including <mark>IFIT1</mark>, <mark>IFIT2</mark>, <mark>IFIT3</mark>, and <mark>IFIT5</mark> in A549 cells.
Induction of <mark>IFIT3</mark> by DV infection was also observed in human dendritic cells.
In a knockdown study, we showed that a <mark>signal transducer and activator of transcription 2</mark> (<mark>STAT2</mark>), but not <mark>STAT1</mark> or <mark>STAT3</mark>, regulated DV-induced <mark>IFIT3</mark> production.
By using several different methods to evaluate cell death, we demonstrated that knockdown of <mark>IFIT3</mark> led to cellular apoptosis.
Furthermore, knockdown of <mark>IFIT3</mark> induced the expression of several apoptotic regulators such as <mark>caspase 3</mark>, <mark>caspase 8</mark>, <mark>caspase 9</mark>, and <mark>Bcl-2-associated X protein</mark> (<mark>BAX</mark>).
Such apoptotic effects and mechanisms were synergistically enhanced after DV infection.
Moreover, under conditions of <mark>IFIT3</mark> deficiency, viral production increased, suggesting an anti-viral effect of <mark>IFIT3</mark>.
Interestingly, DV could suppress <mark>IFN-α</mark>-induced but not <mark>IFN-γ</mark>-induced <mark>IFIT3</mark> expression, a phenomenon similar to the regulation of STATs by DV.
In conclusion, this study revealed some mechanisms of <mark>IFIT3</mark> induction, and also demonstrated the protective roles of <mark>IFIT3</mark> following <mark>IFN-α</mark> production in DV infection of human lung epithelial cells.
<mark>Toll-like receptor</mark> signaling adapter proteins govern spread of neuropathic pain and recovery following nerve injury in male mice.
BACKGROUND: Spinal <mark>Toll-like receptors</mark> (<mark>TLRs</mark>) and signaling intermediaries have been implicated in persistent pain states.
We examined the roles of two major <mark>TLR</mark> signaling pathways and selected <mark>TLRs</mark> in a mononeuropathic allodynia.
METHODS: L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) was performed in wild type (WT, C57BL/6) male and female mice and in male <mark>Tlr2</mark>-/-<mark>Tlr3</mark>-/-, <mark>Tlr4</mark>-/-, <mark>Tlr5</mark>-/-, <mark>Myd88</mark>-/-, <mark>Trif</mark>lps2, <mark>Myd88</mark>/<mark>Trif</mark>lps2, <mark>Tnf</mark>-/-, and <mark>Ifnar1</mark>-/- mice.
We also examined L5 ligation in <mark>Tlr4</mark>-/- female mice.
We examined tactile allodynia using von Frey hairs.
<mark>Iba-1</mark> (microglia) and <mark>GFAP</mark> (astrocytes) were assessed in spinal cords by immunostaining.
Tactile thresholds were analyzed by 1- and 2-way ANOVA and the Bonferroni post hoc test was used.
RESULTS: In WT male and female mice, SNL lesions resulted in a persistent and robust ipsilateral, tactile allodynia.
In males with <mark>TLR2, 3, 4, or 5</mark> deficiencies, tactile allodynia was significantly, but incompletely, reversed (approximately 50%) as compared to WT.
This effect was not seen in female <mark>Tlr4</mark>-/- mice.
Increases in ipsilateral lumbar <mark>Iba-1</mark> and <mark>GFAP</mark> were seen in mutant and WT mice.
Mice deficient in <mark>MyD88</mark>, or <mark>MyD88</mark> and <mark>TRIF</mark>, showed an approximately 50% reduction in withdrawal thresholds and reduced ipsilateral <mark>Iba-1</mark>.
In contrast, <mark>TRIF</mark> and interferon receptor null mice developed a profound ipsilateral and contralateral tactile allodynia.
In lumbar sections of the spinal cords, we observed a greater increase in <mark>Iba-1</mark> immunoreactivity in the <mark>TRIF</mark>-signaling deficient mice as compared to WT, but no significant increase in <mark>GFAP</mark>.
Removing <mark>MyD88</mark> abrogated the contralateral allodynia in the <mark>TRIF</mark> signaling-deficient mice.
Conversely, <mark>IFNβ</mark>, released downstream to <mark>TRIF</mark> signaling, administered intrathecally, temporarily reversed the tactile allodynia.
CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest a critical role for the <mark>MyD88</mark> pathway in initiating neuropathic pain, but a distinct role for the <mark>TRIF</mark> pathway and interferon in regulating neuropathic pain phenotypes in male mice.
<mark>XB130</mark> promotes proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cells.
BACKGROUND: <mark>XB130</mark> has been reported to be expressed by various types of cells such as thyroid cancer and esophageal cancer cells, and it promotes the proliferation and invasion of thyroid cancer cells.
Our previous study demonstrated that <mark>XB130</mark> is also expressed in gastric cancer (GC), and that its expression is associated with the prognosis, but the role of <mark>XB130</mark> in GC has not been well characterized.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the influence of <mark>XB130</mark> on gastric tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo and in vitro using the MTT assay, clonogenic assay, BrdU incorporation assay, 3D culture, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.
Western blot analysis was also performed to identify the potential mechanisms involved.
RESULTS: The proliferation, migration, and invasion of SGC7901 and MNK45 gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines were all significantly inhibited by knockdown of <mark>XB130</mark> using small hairpin RNA.
In a xenograft model, tumor growth was markedly inhibited after sh<mark>XB130</mark>-transfected GC cells were implanted into nude mice.
After <mark>XB130</mark> knockdown, GC cells showed a more epithelial-like phenotype, suggesting an inhibition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process.
In addition, silencing of <mark>XB130</mark> reduced the expression of p-<mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark>, upregulated expression of epithelial markers including <mark>E-cadherin</mark>, <mark>α-catenin</mark> and <mark>β-catenin</mark>, and downregulated mesenchymal markers including <mark>fibronectin</mark> and <mark>vimentin</mark>.
Expression of oncoproteins related to tumor metastasis, such as <mark>MMP2</mark>, <mark>MMP9</mark>, and <mark>CD44</mark>, was also significantly reduced.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that <mark>XB130</mark> enhances cell motility and invasiveness by modulating the EMT-like process, while silencing <mark>XB130</mark> in GC suppresses tumorigenesis and metastasis, suggesting that it may be a potential therapeutic target.
Human hepatic progenitor cells express hematopoietic cell markers <mark>CD45</mark> and <mark>CD109</mark>.
OBJECTIVE: To clarify the precise characteristics of human hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) for future cytotherapy in liver diseases.
METHODS: Hepatic progenitor-like cells were isolated and cultured from the livers of patients who had undergone partial hepatectomy for various pathologies but displayed no sign of hepatic dysfunction.
These cells were characterized by transcriptomic profiling, quantitative real-time PCR and immunocyto/histochemistry.
RESULTS: Cultured HPCs contained polygonal, high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio and exhibited a global gene expression profile similar (67.8%) to that of primary hepatocytes.
Among the genes with more than 20-fold higher expression in HPCs were a progenitor marker (<mark>CD90</mark>), a <mark>pentraxin</mark>-related gene (<mark>PTX3</mark>), <mark>collagen</mark> proteins (<mark>COL5A2</mark>, <mark>COL1A1</mark> and <mark>COL4A2</mark>), <mark>cytokines</mark> (<mark>EGF</mark> and <mark>PDGFD</mark>), metabolic enzymes (<mark>CYBRD1</mark>, <mark>BCAT1</mark>, <mark>TIMP2</mark> and <mark>PAM</mark>), a secreted protein (<mark>SPARC</mark>) and an <mark>endothelial protein C receptor</mark> (<mark>PROCR</mark>).
Moreover, eight markers (<mark>ALB</mark>, <mark>AFP</mark>, <mark>CK8</mark>, <mark>CK18</mark>, <mark>CK19</mark>, <mark>CD90</mark>, <mark>CD117</mark> and <mark>Oval-6</mark>) previously described as HPC markers were validated by qRT-PCR and/or immunocyto/histochemistry.
Interestingly, human HPCs were also positive for the hematopoietic cell markers <mark>CD45</mark> and <mark>CD109</mark>.
Finally, we characterized the localization of HPCs in the canals of Hering and periportal areas with six previously described markers (<mark>Oval-6</mark>, <mark>CK8</mark>, <mark>CK18</mark>, <mark>CK19</mark>, <mark>CD90</mark> and <mark>CD117</mark>) and two potential markers (<mark>CD45</mark> and <mark>CD109</mark>).
CONCLUSION: The human HPCs are highly similar to primary hepatocytes in their transcriptional profiles.
The <mark>CD45</mark> and <mark>CD109</mark> markers could potentially be utilized to identify and isolate HPCs for further cytotherapy of liver diseases.
Mycobacterium massiliense induces inflammatory responses in macrophages through <mark>Toll-like receptor 2</mark> and <mark>c-Jun N-terminal kinase</mark>.
Mycobacterium massiliense (Mmass) is an emerging, rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM) that belongs to the M. abscessus (Mabc) group, albeit clearly differentiated from Mabc.
Compared with M. tuberculosis, a well-characterized human pathogen, the host innate immune response against Mmass infection is largely unknown.
In this study, we show that Mmass robustly activates mRNA and protein expression of <mark>tumor n<mark>tumor necrosis factor</mark>α<<mark>TNF)-α</mark> and <mark>interleukin (IL)-6</mark> in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs).
<mark>Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2</mark> and <mark>myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88</mark> (<mark>MyD88</mark>), but neither <mark>TLR4</mark> nor <mark>Dectin-1</mark>, are involved in Mmass-induced <mark>TNF-α</mark> or <mark>IL-6</mark> production in BMDMs.
Mmass infection also activates the <mark>mitogen-activated protein kinase</mark> (<mark>MAPKs</mark>; <mark>c-Jun N-terminal kinase</mark> (<mark>JNK</mark>), <mark>ERK1/2</mark> and <mark>p38 MAPK</mark>) pathway.
Mmass-induced <mark>TNF-α</mark> and <mark>IL-6</mark> production was dependent on <mark>JNK</mark> activation, while they were unaffected by either the <mark>ERK1/2</mark> or <mark>p38</mark> pathway in BMDMs.
Additionally, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), <mark>NADPH oxidase-2</mark>, and <mark>nuclear <mark>uclear factor-κB</mark> are required for Mmass-induced proinflammatory <mark>cytokine</mark> generation in macrophages.
Furthermore, the S morphotype of Mmass showed lower overall induction of pro-inflammatory (<mark>TNF-α</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, and <mark>IL-1β</mark>) and anti-inflammatory (<mark>IL-10</mark>) <mark>cytokines</mark> than the R morphotype, suggesting fewer immunogenic characteristics for this clinical strain.
Together, these results suggest that Mmass-induced activation of host proinflammatory <mark>cytokines</mark> is mediated through <mark>TLR2</mark>-dependent <mark>JNK</mark> and ROS signaling pathways.
Cultured mycelium Cordyceps sinensis protects liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in acute liver injured mice.
Cultured mycelium Cordyceps sinensis (CMCS) was widely used for a variety of diseases including liver injury, the current study aims to investigate the protective effects of CMCS on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) in acute injury liver and related action mechanisms.
The mice were injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and D-galactosamine (D-GalN).
39 male BABL/c mice were randomly divided into four groups: normal control, model control, CMCS treatment and 1,10-phenanthroline treatment groups.
The Serum liver function parameters including <mark>alanine aminotransferase</mark> (<mark>ALT</mark>) and <mark>aspartate aminotransferase</mark> (<mark>AST</mark>) levels were assayed with the commercial kit.
The inflammation and scaffold structure in liver were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and silver staining respectively.
The LSECs and sub-endothelial basement membrane were observed with the scanning and transmission electronic microscope.
The protein expressions of <mark>intercellular adhesion molecule-1</mark> (<mark>ICAM-1</mark>) and <mark>vascular cell adhesion molecule-1</mark> (<mark>VCAM-1</mark>) in liver were analyzed with Western blotting.
Expression of <mark>von Willebrand factor</mark> (<mark>vWF</mark>) was investigated with immunofluorescence staining.
The lipid peroxidation indicators including antisuperoxideanion (ASAFR), hydroxyl free radical (·OH), <mark>superoxide dismutase</mark> (<mark>SOD</mark>), malondialdehyde and <mark>glutathione S-transferase</mark> (<mark>GST</mark>) were determined with kits, and <mark>matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 9</mark> (<mark>MMP-2/9</mark>) activities in liver were analyzed with gelatin zymography and in situ fluorescent zymography respectively.
The model mice had much higher serum levels of <mark>ALT</mark> and <mark>AST</mark> than the normal mice.
Compared to that in the normal control, more severe liver inflammation and hepatocyte apoptosis, worse hepatic lipid peroxidation demonstrated by the increased ASAFR, ·OH and MDA, but decreased <mark>SOD</mark> and <mark>GST</mark>, increased <mark>MMP-2/9</mark> activities and <mark>VCAM-1</mark>, <mark>ICAM-1</mark> and <mark>vWF</mark> expressions, which revealed obvious LSEC injury and scaffold structure broken, were shown in the model control.
Compared with the model group, CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline significantly improved serum <mark>ALT</mark>/<mark>AST</mark>, attenuated hepatic inflammation and improved peroxidative injury in liver, decreased <mark>MMP-2/9</mark> activities in liver tissue, improved integration of scaffold structure, and decreased protein expression of <mark>VCAM-1</mark> and <mark>ICAM-1</mark>.
CMCS could protect LSECs from injury and maintain the microvasculature integration in acute injured liver of mice induced by LPS/D-GalN. Its action mechanism was associated with the down-regulation of <mark>MMP-2/9</mark> activities and inhibition of peroxidation in injured liver.
Loss of <mark>Bak</mark> enhances lymphocytosis but does not ameliorate thrombocytopaenia in <mark>BCL-2</mark> transgenic mice.
<mark>Bax</mark> and <mark>Bak</mark> are critical effectors of apoptosis.
Although both are widely expressed and usually functionally redundant, recent studies suggest that <mark>Bak</mark> has particular importance in certain cell types.
Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that <mark>Bak</mark> activation is prevented primarily by <mark>Mcl-1</mark> and <mark>Bcl-xL</mark>, whereas <mark>Bax</mark> is held in check by all pro-survival <mark>Bcl-2</mark> homologues, including <mark>Bcl-2</mark> itself.
In this study, we have investigated whether loss of <mark>Bak</mark> or elevated <mark>Mcl-1</mark> modulates haemopoietic abnormalities provoked by overexpression of <mark>Bcl-2</mark>.
The <mark>Mcl-1</mark> transgene had little impact, probably because the expression level was insufficient to effectively reduce <mark>Bak</mark> activation.
However, loss of <mark>Bak</mark> enhanced lymphocytosis in <mark>vav</mark>P-<mark>BCL-2</mark> transgenic mice and increased resistance of their thymocytes to some cytotoxic agents, implying that <mark>Bak</mark>-specific signals can be triggered in certain lymphoid populations.
Nevertheless, lack of <mark>Bak</mark> had no significant impact on thymic abnormalities in <mark>vav</mark>P-<mark>BCL-2</mark>tg mice, which kinetic analysis suggested was due to accumulation of self-reactive thymocytes that resist deletion.
Intriguingly, although <mark>Bak</mark>(-/-) mice have elevated platelet counts, <mark>Bak</mark>(-/-)<mark>vav</mark>P-<mark>BCL-2</mark> mice, like <mark>vav</mark>P-<mark>BCL-2</mark> littermates, were thrombocytopaenic.
To clarify why, the <mark>vav</mark>P-<mark>BCL-2</mark> platelet phenotype was scrutinised more closely.
Platelet life span was found to be elevated in <mark>vav</mark>P-<mark>BCL-2</mark> mice, which should have provoked thrombocytosis, as in <mark>Bak</mark>(-/-) mice.
Analysis of bone marrow chimaeric mice suggested the low platelet phenotype was due principally to extrinsic factors.
Following splenectomy, blood platelets remained lower in <mark>vav</mark>P-<mark>BCL-2</mark> than wild-type mice.
However, in <mark>Rag1</mark>(-/-) <mark>BCL-2</mark>tg mice, platelet levels were normal, implying that elevated lymphocytes are primarily responsible for <mark>BCL-2</mark>tg-induced thrombocytopaenia.
The -930A>G polymorphism of the <mark>CYBA</mark> gene is associated with premature coronary artery disease.
A case-control study and gene-risk factors interactions.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD).
<mark>NADPH oxidases</mark> are the main source of ROS in the vasculature.
<mark>p22phox</mark> is a critical component of vascular <mark>NADPH oxidases</mark> and is encoded by the <mark>CYBA</mark> (<mark>cytochrome b245 alpha</mark>) gene.
The -930A>G <mark>CYBA</mark> polymorphism (rs9932581:A>G) modulates the activity of the <mark>CYBA</mark> promoter, and influences <mark>CYBA</mark> transcriptional activity.
The aim of the present study was to analyze a possible association between the -930A>G polymorphism and CAD and to search for gene-traditional risk factors interactions.
480 subjects were studied: 240 patients with premature CAD, 240 age and sex matched blood donors.
The -930A>G polymorphism was genotyped using the TaqMan® Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems).
The -930G allele carrier state was a risk factor for CAD (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.21-3.44, P=0.007).
A synergistic effect of the -930G allele with overweight/obesity (BMI≥25) and cigarette smoking was found.
The estimated CAD risk for BMI≥25 and the -930G allele interaction was about 160% greater than that predicted by assuming additivity of the effects, and about 40% greater for interaction of cigarette smoking and the -930G allele.
Overweight/obesity was a risk factor for CAD only in the -930G allele carriers (P<10(-10)) but not in the AA homozygotes (P=1.00).
In conclusion the -930A>G <mark>CYBA</mark> polymorphism is associated with CAD in the Polish population.
The -930G allele carriers are particularly at risk of consequences of obesity and tobacco smoke exposure.
Disruption of the temporally regulated cloaca endodermal <mark>β-catenin</mark> signaling causes anorectal malformations.
The cloaca is temporally formed and eventually divided by the urorectal septum (URS) during urogenital and anorectal organ development.
Although congenital malformations, such as anorectal malformations (ARMs), are frequently observed during this process, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear.
<mark>β-Catenin</mark> is a critical component of canonical <mark>Wnt</mark> signaling and is essential for the regulation of cell differentiation and morphogenesis during embryogenesis.
The expression of <mark>β-catenin</mark> is observed in endodermal epithelia, including URS epithelia.
We modulated the <mark>β-catenin</mark> gene conditionally in endodermal epithelia by utilizing tamoxifen-inducible Cre driver line (<mark>Shh</mark>(CreERT2)).
Both <mark>β-catenin</mark> loss- and gain-of-function (LOF and GOF) mutants displayed abnormal clefts in the perineal region and hypoplastic elongation of the URS.
The mutants also displayed reduced cell proliferation in the URS mesenchyme.
In addition, the <mark>β-catenin</mark> GOF mutants displayed reduced apoptosis and subsequently increased apoptosis in the URS epithelium.
This instability possibly resulted in reduced expression levels of differentiation markers, such as <mark>keratin 1</mark> and <mark>filaggrin</mark>, in the perineal epithelia.
The expression of <mark>bone morphogenetic protein</mark> (<mark>Bmp</mark>) genes, such as <mark>Bmp4</mark> and <mark>Bmp7</mark>, was also ectopically induced in the epithelia of the URS in the <mark>β-catenin</mark> GOF mutants.
The expression of the <mark>Msx2</mark> gene and phosphorylated-<mark>Smad1/5/8</mark>, possible readouts of <mark>Bmp</mark> signaling, was also increased in the mutants.
Moreover, we introduced an additional mutation for a <mark>Bmp receptor</mark> gene: <mark>BmprIA</mark>.
The <mark>Shh</mark>(CreERT2/+); <mark>β-catenin</mark>(flox(ex3)/+); <mark>BmprIA</mark>(flox/-) mutants displayed partial restoration of URS elongation compared with the <mark>β-catenin</mark> GOF mutants.
These results indicate that some ARM phenotypes in the <mark>β-catenin</mark> GOF mutants were caused by abnormal <mark>Bmp</mark> signaling.
The current analysis revealed the close relation of endodermal <mark>β-catenin</mark> signaling to the ARM phenotypes.
These results are considered to shed light on the pathogenic mechanisms of human ARMs.
<mark>Endothelial NADPH o<mark>NADPH oxidase 4</mark> mediates <mark>vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2</mark>-induced intravitreal neovascularization in a rat model of retinopathy of prematurity.
PURPOSE: <mark>NADPH oxidase</mark>-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in angiogenesis.
Isoforms of <mark>NADPH oxidase</mark> <mark>NOX1</mark>, <mark>NOX2</mark>, and <mark>NOX4</mark> are reported to be expressed in endothelial cells (ECs).
Of these, <mark>NOX1</mark> and <mark>NOX2</mark> have been reported to contribute to intravitreal neovascularization (IVNV) in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) models.
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the isoform <mark>NOX4</mark> in ECs contributed to <mark>vascular endothelial growth factor</mark> (<mark>VEGF</mark>)-induced angiogenesis and IVNV.
METHODS: Isoforms of <mark>NADPH oxidase</mark> MRNA were measured in several types of cultured vascular ecs: human retinal microvascular ECs (hRMVECs), choroidal ECs (CECs), and human umbilical vascular ECs (HUVECs) using real-time PCR.
Newborn rat pups and dams were placed into an OIR model that cycled oxygen concentration between 50% and 10% every 24 h for 14 days, and then were placed in room air (RA) for an additional 4 days (rat OIR model).
<mark>NOX4</mark> expression in retinal lysates from the RA-raised pups at postnatal day 0 (P0), P14, and P18 was determined with western blots.
<mark>STAT3</mark> activation was determined as the ratio of phosphorylated <mark>STAT3</mark> to total <mark>STAT3</mark> with western blot analysis of retinal lysates from pups raised in RA or from the rat OIR model at P18.
Semiquantitative assessment of the density of <mark>NOX4</mark> colabeling with lectin-stained retinal ECs was determined by immunolabeling of retinal cryosections from P18 pups in OIR or in RA.
In hRMVECs transfected with <mark>NOX4</mark> siRNA and treated with <mark>VEGF</mark> or control, 1) ROS generation was measured using the 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester fluorescence assay and 2) phosphorylated <mark>VEGF receptor 2</mark> and <mark>STAT3</mark>, and total <mark>VEGFR2</mark> and <mark>STAT3</mark> were measured in western blot analyses.
<mark>VEGF</mark>-stimulated hRMVEC proliferation was measured following transfection with <mark>NOX4</mark> siRNA or <mark>STAT3</mark> siRNA, or respective controls.
RESULTS: <mark>NOX4</mark> was the most prevalent isoform of <mark>NADPH oxidase</mark> in vascular ECs.
<mark>NOX4</mark> expression in retinal lysates was significantly decreased during development in RA.
Compared to RA, the expression of retinal <mark>NOX4</mark> increased at P18.
At p18 OIR, semiquantitative assessment of the density of lectin and <mark>NOX4</mark> colabeling in retinal vascular ECs was greater in retinal cryosections and activated <mark>STAT3</mark> was greater in retinal lysates when compared to the RA-raised pups.
In cultured hRMVECs, knockdown of <mark>NOX4</mark> by siRNA transfection inhibited <mark>VEGF</mark>-induced ROS generation.
<mark>VEGF</mark> induced a physical interaction of phosphorylated-<mark>VEGFR2</mark> and <mark>NOX4</mark>.
Knockdown of <mark>NOX4</mark>: 1) reduced <mark>VEGFR2</mark> activation but did not abolish it and 2) abolished <mark>STAT3</mark> activation in response to <mark>VEGF</mark>.
Knockdown of either <mark>NOX4</mark> or <mark>STAT3</mark> inhibited <mark>VEGF</mark>-induced EC proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that in a model representative of human retinopathy of prematurity, <mark>NOX4</mark> was increased at a time point when IVNV developed.
<mark>VEGF</mark>-activated <mark>NOX4</mark> led to an interaction between <mark>VEGF</mark>-activated <mark>VEGFR2</mark> and <mark>NOX4</mark> that mediated EC proliferation via activation of <mark>STAT3</mark>.
Altogether, our results suggest that <mark>NOX4</mark> may regulate <mark>VEGFR2</mark>-mediated IVNV through activated <mark>STAT3</mark>.
Dysregulation of <mark>Wnt inhibitory factor 1</mark> (<mark>Wif1</mark>) expression resulted in aberrant <mark>Wnt</mark>-<mark>b-catenin</mark> signaling and cell death of the cloaca endoderm, and anorectal malformations.
In mammalian urorectal development, the urorectal septum (urs) descends from the ventral body wall to the cloaca membrane (cm) to partition the cloaca into urogenital sinus and rectum.
Defective urs growth results in human congenital anorectal malformations (ARMs), and their pathogenic mechanisms are unclear.
Recent studies only focused on the importance of urs mesenchyme proliferation, which is induced by endoderm-derived <mark>Sonic Hedgehog</mark> (<mark>Shh</mark>).
Here, we showed that the programmed cell death of the apical urs and proximal cm endoderm is particularly crucial for the growth of urs during septation.
The apoptotic endoderm was closely associated with the tempo-spatial expression of <mark>Wnt inhibitory factor 1</mark> (<mark>Wif1</mark>), which is an inhibitor of <mark>Wnt</mark>-<mark>β-catenin</mark> signaling.
In <mark>Wif1</mark>(lacZ/lacZ) mutant mice and cultured urorectum with exogenous <mark>Wif1</mark>, cloaca septation was defective with undescended urs and hypospadias-like phenotypes, and such septation defects were also observed in <mark>Shh</mark>(-/-) mutants and in endodermal <mark>β-catenin</mark> gain-of-function (GOF) mutants.
In addition, <mark>Wif1</mark> and <mark>Shh</mark> were expressed in a complementary manner in the cloaca endoderm, and <mark>Wif1</mark> was ectopically expressed in the urs and cm associated with excessive endodermal apoptosis and septation defects in <mark>Shh</mark>(-/-) mutants.
Furthermore, apoptotic cells were markedly reduced in the endodermal <mark>β-catenin</mark> GOF mutant embryos, which counteracted the inhibitory effects of <mark>Wif1</mark>.
Taken altogether, these data suggest that regulated expression of <mark>Wif1</mark> is critical for the growth of the urs during cloaca septation.
Hence, <mark>Wif1</mark> governs cell apoptosis of urs endoderm by repressing <mark>β-catenin</mark> signal, which may facilitate the protrusion of the underlying proliferating mesenchymal cells towards the cm for cloaca septation.
Dysregulation of this endodermal <mark>Shh</mark>-<mark>Wif1</mark>-<mark>β-catenin</mark> signaling axis contributes to ARM pathogenesis.
Large multiethnic Candidate Gene Study for <mark>C-reactive protein</mark> levels: identification of a novel association at <mark>CD36</mark> in African Americans.
<mark>C-reactive protein</mark> (<mark>CRP</mark>) is a heritable biomarker of systemic inflammation and a predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Large-scale genetic association studies for <mark>CRP</mark> have largely focused on individuals of European descent.
We sought to uncover novel genetic variants for <mark>CRP</mark> in a multiethnic sample using the ITMAT Broad-CARe (IBC) array, a custom 50,000 SNP gene-centric array having dense coverage of over 2,000 candidate CVD genes.
We performed analyses on 7,570 African Americans (AA) from the Candidate gene Association Resource (CARe) study and race-combined meta-analyses that included 29,939 additional individuals of European descent from CARe, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and KORA studies.
We observed array-wide significance (p < 2.2 × 10(-6)) for four loci in AA, three of which have been reported previously in individuals of European descent (<mark>IL6R</mark>, p = 2.0 × 10(-6); <mark>CRP</mark>, p = 4.2 × 10(-71); <mark>APOE</mark>, p = 1.6 × 10(-6)).
The fourth significant locus, <mark>CD36</mark> (p = 1.6 × 10(-6)), was observed at a functional variant (rs3211938) that is extremely rare in individuals of European descent.
We replicated the <mark>CD36</mark> finding (p = 1.8 × 10(-5)) in an independent sample of 8,041 AA women from WHI; a meta-analysis combining the CARe and WHI AA results at rs3211938 reached genome-wide significance (p = 1.5 × 10(-10)).
In the race-combined meta-analyses, 13 loci reached significance, including ten (<mark>CRP</mark>, <mark>TOMM40</mark>/<mark>APOE</mark>/<mark>APOC1</mark>, <mark>HNF1A</mark>, <mark>LEPR</mark>, <mark>GCKR</mark>, <mark>IL6R</mark>, <mark>IL1RN</mark>, <mark>NLRP3</mark>, <mark>HNF4A</mark> and <mark>BAZ1B</mark>/<mark>BCL7B</mark>) previously associated with <mark>CRP</mark>, and one (<mark>ARNTL</mark>) previously reported to be nominally associated with <mark>CRP</mark>.
Two novel loci were also detected (<mark>RPS6KB1</mark>, p = 2.0 × 10(-6); <mark>CD36</mark>, p = 1.4 × 10(-6)).
These results highlight both shared and unique genetic risk factors for <mark>CRP</mark> in AA compared to populations of European descent.
Embelin suppresses growth of human pancreatic cancer xenografts, and pancreatic cancer cells isolated from <mark>Kras</mark>G12D mice by inhibiting <mark>Akt</mark> and <mark>Sonic hedgehog</mark> pathways.
Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease, and therefore effective treatment and/or prevention strategies are urgently needed.
The objectives of this study were to examine the molecular mechanisms by which embelin inhibited human pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro, and xenografts in Balb C nude mice, and pancreatic cancer cell growth isolated from <mark>Kras</mark>G12D transgenic mice.
XTT assays were performed to measure cell viability.
AsPC-1 cells were injected subcutaneously into Balb c nude mice and treated with embelin.
Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by <mark>Ki67</mark> and TUNEL staining, respectively.
The expression of <mark>Akt</mark>, and <mark>Sonic Hedgehog</mark> (<mark>Shh</mark>) and their target gene products were measured by the immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis.
The effects of embelin on pancreatic cancer cells isolated from 10-months old <mark>Kras</mark>G12D mice were also examined.
Embelin inhibited cell viability in pancreatic cancer AsPC-1, PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2 and Hs 766T cell lines, and these inhibitory effects were blocked either by constitutively active <mark>Akt</mark> or <mark>Shh</mark> protein.
Embelin-treated mice showed significant inhibition in tumor growth which was associated with reduced expression of markers of cell proliferation (<mark>Ki67</mark>, <mark>PCNA</mark> and <mark>Bcl-2</mark>) and cell cycle (<mark>cyclin D1</mark>, <mark>CDK2</mark>, and <mark>CDK6</mark>), and induction of apoptosis (activation of <mark>caspase-3</mark> and cleavage of <mark>PARP</mark>, and increased expression of <mark>Bax</mark>).
In addition, embelin inhibited the expression of markers of angiogenesis (<mark>COX-2</mark>, <mark>VEGF</mark>, <mark>VEGFR</mark>, and <mark>IL-8</mark>), and metastasis (<mark>MMP-2</mark> and <mark>MMP-9</mark>) in tumor tissues.
Antitumor activity of embelin was associated with inhibition of <mark>Akt</mark> and <mark>Shh</mark> pathways in xenografts, and pancreatic cancer cells isolated from <mark>Kras</mark>G12D mice.
Furthermore, embelin also inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by up-regulating <mark>E-cadherin</mark> and inhibiting the expression of <mark>Snail</mark>, <mark>Slug</mark>, and <mark>ZEB1</mark>.
These data suggest that embelin can inhibit pancreatic cancer growth, angiogenesis and metastasis by suppressing <mark>Akt</mark> and <mark>Shh</mark> pathways, and can be developed for the treatment and/or prevention of pancreatic cancer.
Reversal of ischemic cardiomyopathy with <mark>Sca-1</mark>+ stem cells modified with multiple <mark>growth factors</mark>.
BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that bone marrow derived <mark>Sca-1</mark>+ stem cells (BM <mark>Sca-1</mark>+) transduced with multiple therapeutic cytokines with diverse effects will induce faster angiomyogenic differentiation in the infarcted myocardium.
METHODS AND RESULTS: BM <mark>Sca-1</mark>+ were purified from transgenic male mice expressing GFP.
Plasmids encoding for select quartet of growth factors, i.e., human <mark>IGF-1</mark>, <mark>VEGF</mark>, <mark>SDF-1α</mark> and <mark>HGF</mark> were prepared and used for genetic modification of <mark>Sca-1</mark>+ cells (GF<mark>Sca-1+<<mark>Sca-1</mark>>).
Scramble transfected cells (Sc<mark>Sca-1</<mark>Sca-1+</mark>) were used as a control.
RT-PCR and western blotting showed significantly higher expression of the growth factors in GF<mark>Sca-1+<<mark>Sca-1</mark>>.
Besides the quartet of the therapeutic growth factors, PCR based growth factor array showed upregulation of multiple angiogenic and prosurvival factors such as <mark>Ang-1</mark>, <mark>Ang-2</mark>, <mark>MMP9</mark>, <mark>Cx43</mark>, <mark>BMP2</mark>, <mark>BMP5</mark>, <mark>FGF2</mark>, and <mark>NGF</mark> in GF<mark>Sca-1+<<mark>Sca-1</mark>> (p<0.01 vs Sc<mark>Sca-1</<mark>Sca-1+</mark>).
LDH and TUNEL assays showed enhanced survival of GF<mark>Sca-1+<<mark>Sca-1</mark>> under lethal anoxia (p<0.01 vs Sc<mark>Sca-1</<mark>Sca-1+</mark>).
MTS assay showed significant increased cell proliferation in GF<mark>Sca-1</<mark>Sca-1+</mark> (p<0.05 vs Sc<mark>Sca-1+<<mark>Sca-1</mark>>).
For in vivo study, female mice were grouped to receive the intramyocardial injection of 15 μl DMEM without cells (group-1) or containing 2.5 × 10(5) Sc<mark>Sca-1+<<mark>Sca-1</mark>> (group-2) or GF<mark>Sca-1+<<mark>Sca-1</mark>> (group-3) immediately after coronary artery ligation.
As indicated by <mark>Sry</mark> gene, a higher survival of GF<mark>Sca-1+<<mark>Sca-1</mark>> in group-3 on day 4 (2.3 fold higher vs group-2) was observed with massive mobilization of stem and progenitor cells (<mark>cKit</mark>+, <mark>Mdr1</mark>+, <mark>Cxcr4</mark>+ cells).
Heart tissue sections immunostained for <mark>actinin</mark> and <mark>Cx43</mark> at 4 weeks post engraftment showed extensive myofiber formation and expression of gap junctions.
Immunostaining for <mark>vWF</mark> showed increased blood vessel density in both peri-infarct and infarct regions in group-3.
Infarct size was attenuated and the global heart function was improved in group-3 as compared to group-2.
CONCLUSIONS: Administration of BM <mark>Sca-1</mark>+ transduced with multiple genes is a novel approach to treat infarcted heart for its regeneration.
<mark>IL-3</mark> and <mark>CSF-1</mark> interact to promote generation of <mark>CD11c</mark>+ <mark>IL-10</mark>-producing macrophages.
Unraveling the mechanisms of hematopoiesis regulated by multiple <mark>cytokines</mark> remains a challenge in hematology.
<mark>IL-3</mark> is an allergic <mark>cytokine</mark> with the multilineage potential, while <mark>CSF-1</mark> is produced in the steady state with restricted lineage coverage.
Here, we uncovered an instructive role of <mark>CSF-1</mark> in <mark>IL-3</mark>-mediated hematopoiesis.
<mark>CSF-1</mark> significantly promoted <mark>IL-3</mark>-driven <mark>CD11c</mark>+ cell expansion and dampened basophil and mast cell generation from C57BL/6 bone marrow.
Further studies indicated that the <mark>CSF-1</mark>/<mark>CSF-1R</mark> axis contributed significantly to <mark>IL-3</mark>-induced <mark>CD11c</mark>+ cell generation through enhancing <mark>c-Fos</mark>-associated monopoiesis.
<mark>CD11c</mark>+ cells induced by <mark>IL-3</mark> or <mark>IL-3</mark>/<mark>CSF-1</mark> were competent in cellular maturation and endocytosis.
Both <mark>IL-3</mark> and <mark>IL-3</mark>/<mark>CSF-1</mark> cells lacked classical dendritic cell appearance and resembled macrophages in morphology.
Both populations produced a high level of <mark>IL-10</mark>, in addition to <mark>IL-1</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark> and <mark>TNFα</mark>, in response to LPS, and were relatively poor T cell stimulators.
Collectively, these findings reveal a role for <mark>CSF-1</mark> in mediating the <mark>IL-3</mark> hematopoietic pathway through monopoiesis, which regulates expansion of <mark>CD11c</mark>+ macrophages.
Structural mechanisms determining inhibition of the <mark>collagen receptor</mark> <mark>DDR1</mark> by selective and multi-targeted type II kinase inhibitors.
The <mark>discoidin domain receptors</mark> (<mark>DDRs</mark>), <mark>DDR1</mark> and <mark>DDR2</mark>, form a unique subfamily of <mark>receptor tyrosine kinases</mark> that are activated by the binding of triple-helical <mark>collagen</mark>.
Excessive signaling by <mark>DDR1</mark> and <mark>DDR2</mark> has been linked to the progression of various human diseases, including fibrosis, atherosclerosis and cancer.
We report the inhibition of these unusual <mark>receptor tyrosine kinases</mark> by the multi-targeted cancer drugs imatinib and ponatinib, as well as the selective type II inhibitor <mark>DDR1</mark>-IN-1.
Ponatinib is identified as the more potent molecule, which inhibits <mark>DDR1</mark> and <mark>DDR2</mark> with an IC50 of 9nM. Co-crystal structures of human <mark>DDR1</mark> reveal a DFG-out conformation (DFG, Asp-Phe-Gly) of the kinase domain that is stabilized by an unusual salt bridge between the activation loop and αD helix.
Differences to <mark>Abelson kinase</mark> (<mark>ABL</mark>) are observed in the <mark>DDR1</mark> P-loop, where a β-hairpin replaces the cage-like structure of <mark>ABL</mark>.
P-loop residues in <mark>DDR1</mark> that confer drug resistance in <mark>ABL</mark> are therefore accommodated outside the ATP pocket.
Whereas imatinib and ponatinib bind potently to both the <mark>DDR</mark> and <mark>ABL</mark> kinases, the hydrophobic interactions of the <mark>ABL</mark> P-loop appear poorly satisfied by <mark>DDR1</mark>-IN-1 suggesting a structural basis for its <mark>DDR1</mark> selectivity.
Such inhibitors may have applications in clinical indications of <mark>DDR1</mark> and <mark>DDR2</mark> overexpression or mutation, including lung cancer.
<mark>Thyroid hormone receptor α</mark> mutation causes a severe and thyroxine-resistant skeletal dysplasia in female mice.
A new genetic disorder has been identified that results from mutation of <mark>THRA</mark>, encoding <mark>thyroid hormone receptor a1</mark> (<mark>TRa1</mark>).
Affected children have a high serum T3:T4 ratio and variable degrees of intellectual deficit and constipation but exhibit a consistently severe skeletal dysplasia.
In an attempt to improve developmental delay and alleviate symptoms of hypothyroidism, patients are receiving varying doses and durations of T4 treatment, but responses have been inconsistent so far. <mark>Thra1</mark>(PV/+) mice express a similar potent dominant-negative mutant <mark>TRa1</mark> to affected individuals, and thus represent an excellent disease model.
We hypothesized that <mark>Thra1</mark>(PV/+) mice could be used to predict the skeletal outcome of human <mark>THRA</mark> mutations and determine whether prolonged treatment with a supraphysiological dose of T4 ameliorates the skeletal abnormalities.
Adult female <mark>Thra1</mark>(PV/+) mice had short stature, grossly abnormal bone morphology but normal bone strength despite high bone mass.
Although T4 treatment suppressed <mark>TSH</mark> secretion, it had no effect on skeletal maturation, linear growth, or bone mineralization, thus demonstrating profound tissue resistance to thyroid hormone.
Despite this, prolonged T4 treatment abnormally increased bone stiffness and strength, suggesting the potential for detrimental consequences in the long term.
Our studies establish that <mark>TRα1</mark> has an essential role in the developing and adult skeleton and predict that patients with different <mark>THRA</mark> mutations will display variable responses to T4 treatment, which depend on the severity of the causative mutation.
Functional characterization of obesity-associated variants involving the α and β isoforms of human <mark>SH2B1</mark>.
We have previously reported rare variants in sarcoma <mark>(Src) homology 2 (SH2) B adaptor protein 1</mark> (<mark>SH2B1</mark>) in individuals with obesity, <mark>insulin</mark> resistance, and maladaptive behavior.
Here, we identify 4 additional <mark>SH2B1</mark> variants by sequencing 500 individuals with severe early-onset obesity.
<mark>SH2B1</mark> has 4 alternatively spliced isoforms.
One variant (T546A) lies within the N-terminal region common to all isoforms.
As shown for past variants in this region, T546A impairs <mark>SH2B1</mark>β enhancement of nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth, and the individual with the T546A variant exhibits mild developmental delay.
The other 3 variants (A663V, V695M, and A723V) lie in the C-terminal tail of <mark>SH2B1</mark>α.
<mark>SH2B1</mark>α variant carriers were hyperinsulinemic but did not exhibit the behavioral phenotype observed in individuals with <mark>SH2B1</mark> variants that disrupt all isoforms.
In in vitro assays, <mark>SH2B1</<mark>SH2B1α</mark>, like <mark>SH2B1β<<mark>SH2B1</mark>>, enhances <mark>insulin</mark>- and <mark>leptin</mark>-induced <mark>insulin receptor substrate 2</mark> (<mark>IRS2</mark>) phosphorylation and GH-induced cell motility.
None of the variants affect <mark>SH2B1</mark>α enhancement of <mark>insulin</mark>- and <mark>leptin</mark>-induced <mark>IRS2</mark> phosphorylation.
However, T546A, A663V, and A723V all impair the ability of <mark>SH2B1</mark>α to enhance GH-induced cell motility.
In contrast to <mark>SH2B1</mark>β, <mark>SH2B1</mark>α does not enhance nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth.
These studies suggest that genetic variants that disrupt isoforms other than <mark>SH2B1</mark>β may be functionally significant.
Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism by which the individual isoforms regulate energy homeostasis and behavior.
Copy number analysis of 24 <mark>oncogenes</mark>: <mark>MDM4</mark> identified as a putative marker for low recurrence risk in non muscle invasive bladder cancer.
Patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) generally have a high risk of relapsing locally after primary tumor resection.
The search for new predictive markers of local recurrence thus represents an important goal for the management of this disease.
We studied the copy number variations (CNVs) of 24 <mark>oncogenes</mark> (<mark>MDM4</mark>, <mark>MYCN</mark>, <mark>ALK</mark>, <mark>PDGFRA</mark>, <mark>KIT</mark>, <mark>KDR</mark>, <mark>DHFR</mark>, <mark>EGFR</mark>, <mark>MET</mark>, <mark>SMO</mark>, <mark>FGFR1</mark>, <mark>MYC</mark>, <mark>ABL1</mark>, <mark>RET</mark>, <mark>CCND1</mark>, <mark>CCND2</mark>, <mark>CDK4</mark>, <mark>MDM2</mark>, <mark>AURKB</mark>, <mark>ERBB2</mark>, <mark>TOP2A</mark>, <mark>AURKA</mark>, <mark>AR</mark> and <mark>BRAF</mark>) using multiplex ligation probe amplification technique to verify their role as predictive markers of recurrence.
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 43 patients who underwent transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) were used; 23 patients had relapsed and 20 were disease-free after 5 years.
Amplification frequencies were analyzed for all genes and <mark>MDM4</mark> was the only gene that showed significantly higher amplification in non recurrent patients than in recurrent ones (0.65 vs. 0.3; Fisher's test p=0.023).
Recurrence-free survival analysis confirmed the predictive role of <mark>MDM4</mark> (log-rank test p=0.041).
Our preliminary results indicate a putative role for the <mark>MDM4</mark> gene in predicting local recurrence of bladder cancer.
Confirmation of this hypothesis is needed in a larger cohort of NMIBC patients.
Cadmium-induced ethylene production and responses in Arabidopsis thaliana rely on <mark>ACS2</mark> and <mark>ACS6</mark> gene expression.
BACKGROUND: Anthropogenic activities cause metal pollution worldwide.
Plants can absorb and accumulate these metals through their root system, inducing stress as a result of excess metal concentrations inside the plant.
Ethylene is a regulator of multiple plant processes, and is affected by many biotic and abiotic stresses.
Increased ethylene levels have been observed after exposure to excess metals but it remains unclear how the increased ethylene levels are achieved at the molecular level.
In this study, the effects of cadmium (Cd) exposure on the production of ethylene and its precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), and on the expression of the <mark>ACC Synthase</mark> (<mark>ACS</mark>) and <mark>ACC Oxidase</mark> (<mark>ACO</mark>) multigene families were investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana.
RESULTS: Increased ethylene release after Cd exposure was directly measurable in a system using rockwool-cultivated plants; enhanced levels of the ethylene precursor ACC together with higher mRNA levels of ethylene responsive genes: <mark>ACO2</mark>, <mark>ETR2</mark> and <mark>ERF1</mark> also indicated increased ethylene production in hydroponic culture.
Regarding underlying mechanisms, it was found that the transcript levels of <mark>ACO2</mark> and <mark>ACO4</mark>, the most abundantly expressed members of the <mark>ACO</mark> multigene family, were increased upon Cd exposure.
ACC synthesis is the rate-limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis, and transcript levels of both <mark>ACS2</mark> and <mark>ACS6</mark> showed the highest increase and became the most abundant isoforms after Cd exposure, suggesting their importance in the Cd-induced increase of ethylene production.
CONCLUSIONS: Cadmium induced the biosynthesis of ACC and ethylene in Arabidopsis thaliana plants mainly via the increased expression of <mark>ACS2</mark> and <mark>ACS6</mark>.
This was confirmed in the <mark>acs2</mark>-1<mark>acs6</mark>-1 double knockout mutants, which showed a decreased ethylene production, positively affecting leaf biomass and resulting in a delayed induction of ethylene responsive gene expressions without significant differences in Cd contents between wild-type and mutant plants.
Postnatal exposure to a high-carbohydrate diet interferes epigenetically with <mark>thyroid hormone receptor</mark> induction of the adult male rat <mark>skeletal muscle glucose<mark>glucose transporter isoform 4</mark> expression.
Early life nutritional intervention causes adult-onset <mark>insulin</mark> resistance and obesity in rats.
<mark>Thyroid hormone receptor</mark> (<mark>TR</mark>), in turn, transcriptionally enhances skeletal muscle <mark>Glut4</mark> expression.
We tested the hypothesis that reduced circulating <mark>thyroid-stimulating hormone</mark> and T4 concentrations encountered in postnatal (PN4-PN24) high-carbohydrate (HC) milk formula-fed versus the mother-fed controls (MF) would epigenetically interfere with <mark>TR</mark> induction of adult (100 days) male rat skeletal muscle <mark>Glut4</mark> expression, thereby providing a molecular mechanism mediating <mark>insulin</mark> resistance.
We observed increased DNA methylation of the CpG island with enhanced recruitment of <mark>Dnmt3a</mark>, <mark>Dnmt3b</mark> and <mark>MeCP2</mark> in the <mark>glut4</mark> promoter region along with reduced acetylation of <mark>histone (H)2A.Z</mark> and <mark>H4</mark> particularly at the <mark>H4</mark>.lysine (K)16 residue, which was predominantly mediated by <mark>histone deacetylase 4</mark> (<mark>HDAC4</mark>).
This was followed by enhanced recruitment of <mark>heterochromatin protein 1β</mark> to the <mark>glut4</mark> promoter with increased <mark>Suv39H1 methylase</mark> concentrations.
These changes reduced <mark>TR</mark> binding of the T3 response element of the <mark>glut4</mark> gene (TREs; -473 to -450 bp) detected qualitatively in vivo (electromobility shift assay) and quantified ex vivo (chromatin immunoprecipitation).
In addition, the recruitment of <mark>steroid receptor coactivator</mark> and <mark>CREB-binding protein</mark> to the <mark>glut4</mark> promoter-protein complex was reduced.
Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction between <mark>TR</mark> and <mark>CBP</mark> to be reduced and <mark>HDAC4</mark> to be enhanced in HC versus MF groups.
These molecular changes were associated with diminished skeletal muscle <mark>Glut4</mark> mRNA and protein concentrations.
We conclude that early postnatal exposure to HC diet epigenetically reduced <mark>TR</mark> induction of adult male skeletal muscle <mark>Glut4</mark> expression, uncovering novel molecular mechanisms contributing to adult <mark>insulin</mark> resistance and obesity.
<mark>Twist 1</mark> regulates the expression of <mark>PPARγ</mark> during hormone-induced 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation: a possible role in obesity and associated diseases.
BACKGROUND: <mark>Twist 1</mark> is highly expressed in adipose tissue and has been associated with obesity and related disorders.
However, the molecular function of <mark>Twist 1</mark> in adipose tissue is unclear.
<mark>Twist 1</mark> has been implicated in cell lineage determination and differentiation.
Therefore, we investigated both the role of <mark>Twist 1</mark> in adipocyte precursor mobilization and the relationship of <mark>Twist 1</mark> with other molecular determinants of adipocyte differentiation.
METHODS: We examined <mark>Twist 1</mark> mRNA and protein expression in subcutaneous adipose tissues from diet-induced obese C57/BL6 mice and Wistar rats and in obese patients undergoing liposuction or adipose transplant surgeries.
<mark>Twist 1</mark> expression was measured on days 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 of 3T3-L1 differentiation in vitro.
The role of <mark>Twist 1</mark> in adipogenesis was explored using retroviral interference of <mark>Twist 1</mark> expression.
Adipokine secretion was evaluated using a RayBio® Biotin Label-based Adipokine Array.
RESULTS: <mark>Twist 1</mark> mRNA and protein levels were reduced in diet-induced obese mice and rats and in obese humans.
<mark>Twist 1</mark> was upregulated during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation in vitro, beginning from the fourth day of differentiation induction.
Retroviral interference of <mark>Twist 1</mark> expression did not significantly impair lipid formation; however, retroviral interference induced <mark>PPARγ</mark> mRNA and protein expression on day 4 of differentiation induction.
Adipokine array analyses revealed increased secretion of <mark>CXCR4</mark> (19.55-fold), <mark>VEGFR1</mark> (92.13-fold), L-21 R (63.55-fold), and <mark>IL-12 R beta 1</mark> (59.66-fold) and decreased secretion of <mark>VEGFR3</mark> (0.01-fold), <mark>TSLP</mark> R (0.071-fold), <mark>MIP-1 gamma</mark> (0.069-fold), <mark>TNF RI</mark>/<mark>TNFRSF1A</mark> (0.09-fold), and <mark>MFG-E8</mark> (0.06-fold).
CONCLUSIONS: <mark>Twist 1</mark> is a regulator of adipocyte gene expression although it is not likely to regulate differentiation.
We identified <mark>PPARγ</mark> as a potential target of <mark>Twist 1</mark> and found variation in the secretion of multiple adipokines, which might indicate a prospective mechanism linking <mark>Twist 1</mark> expression with obesity or associated diseases.
Mesenchymal stromal cells express <mark>GARP</mark>/<mark>LRRC32</mark> on their surface: effects on their biology and immunomodulatory capacity.
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) represent a promising tool for therapy in regenerative medicine, transplantation, and autoimmune disease due to their trophic and immunomodulatory activities.
However, we are still far from understanding the mechanisms of action of MSCs in these processes.
<mark>Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1</mark> is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in MSC migration, differentiation, and immunomodulation.
Recently, <mark>glycoprotein A repetitions predominant</mark> (<mark>GARP</mark>) was shown to bind <mark>latency-associated peptide</mark> (<mark>LAP</mark>)/<mark>TGF-b1</mark> to the cell surface of activated <mark>Foxp3</mark>(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) and megakaryocytes/platelets.
In this manuscript, we show that human and mouse MSCs express <mark>GARP</mark> which presents <mark>LAP</mark>/<mark>TGF-β1</mark> on their cell surface.
Silencing <mark>GARP</mark> expression in MSCs increased their secretion and activation of <mark>TGF-b1</mark> and reduced their proliferative capacity in a <mark>TGF-b1</mark>-independent manner.
Importantly, we showed that <mark>GARP</mark> expression on MSCs contributed to their ability to inhibit T-cell responses in vitro.
In summary, we have found that <mark>GARP</mark> is an essential molecule for MSC biology, regulating their immunomodulatory and proliferative activities.
We envision <mark>GARP</mark> as a new target for improving the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs and also as a novel MSC marker.
<mark>Ena</mark>/<mark>VASP</mark> proteins cooperate with the <mark>WAVE complex</mark> to regulate the <mark>actin</mark> cytoskeleton.
<mark>Ena</mark>/<mark>VASP</mark> proteins and the <mark>WAVE re<mark>WAVE regulatory complex</mark>/m<mark>WRC</mark>> regulate cell motility by virtue of their ability to independently promote <mark>actin</mark> polymerization.
We demonstrate that <mark>Ena</mark>/<mark>VASP</mark> and the <mark>WRC</mark> control <mark>actin</mark> polymerization in a cooperative manner through the interaction of the <mark>Ena</mark>/<mark>VASP</mark> EVH1 domain with an extended proline rich motif in <mark>Abi</mark>.
This interaction increases cell migration and enables <mark>VASP</mark> to cooperatively enhance <mark>WRC</mark> stimulation of <mark>Arp2/3<<mark>Arp2</mark>k<mark>3</mark> complex-mediated <mark>actin</mark> assembly in vitro in the presence of <mark>Rac</mark>.
Loss of this interaction in Drosophila macrophages results in defects in lamellipodia formation, cell spreading, and redistribution of <mark>Ena</mark> to the tips of filopodia-like extensions.
Rescue experiments of <mark>abi</mark> mutants also reveals a physiological requirement for the <mark>Abi</mark>:<mark>Ena</mark> interaction in photoreceptor axon targeting and oogenesis.
Our data demonstrate that the activities of <mark>Ena</mark>/<mark>VASP</mark> and the <mark>WRC</mark> are intimately linked to ensure optimal control of <mark>actin</mark> polymerization during cell migration and development.
<mark>RBFOX1</mark> cooperates with <mark>MBNL1</mark> to control splicing in muscle, including events altered in myotonic dystrophy type 1.
With the goal of identifying splicing alterations in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1) tissues that may yield insights into targets or mechanisms, we have surveyed mis-splicing events in three systems using a RT-PCR screening and validation platform.
First, a transgenic mouse model expressing CUG-repeats identified splicing alterations shared with other mouse models of DM1.
Second, using cell cultures from human embryonic muscle, we noted that DM1-associated splicing alterations were significantly enriched in cytoskeleton (e.g. <mark>SORBS1</mark>, <mark>TACC2</mark>, <mark>TTN</mark>, <mark>ACTN1</mark> and <mark>DMD</mark>) and channel (e.g. <mark>KCND3</mark> and <mark>TRPM4</mark>) genes.
Third, of the splicing alterations occurring in adult DM1 tissues, one produced a dominant negative variant of the splicing regulator <mark>RBFOX1</mark>.
Notably, half of the splicing events controlled by <mark>MBNL1</mark> were co-regulated by <mark>RBFOX1</mark>, and several events in this category were mis-spliced in DM1 tissues.
Our results suggest that reduced <mark>RBFOX1</mark> activity in DM1 tissues may amplify several of the splicing alterations caused by the deficiency in <mark>MBNL1</mark>.
Sepsis-induced changes in <mark>amino acid transporters</mark> and leucine signaling via <mark>mTOR</mark> in skeletal muscle.
The present study tested the hypothesis that sepsis-induced leucine (Leu) resistance in skeletal muscle is associated with a down-regulation of <mark>amino acid transporters</mark> important in regulating Leu flux or an impairment in the formation of the Leu-sensitive <mark>mTOR</mark>-<mark>Ragulator complex</mark>.
Sepsis in adult male rats decreased basal protein synthesis in gastrocnemius, associated with a reduction in <mark>mTOR</mark> activation as indicated by decreased <mark>4E-BP1</mark> and S6K1 phosphorylation.
The ability of oral Leu to increase protein synthesis and <mark>mTOR</mark> <mark>kinase</mark> after 1 h was largely prevented in sepsis.
Sepsis increased <mark>CAT1</mark>, <mark>LAT2</mark> and <mark>SNAT2</mark> mRNA content two- to fourfold, but only the protein content for <mark>CAT1</mark> (20 % decrease) differed significantly.
Conversely, sepsis decreased the <mark>proton-assisted amino acid transporter (PAT)-2</mark> mRNA by 60 %, but without a coordinate change in <mark>PAT2</mark> protein.
There was no sepsis or Leu effect on the protein content for <mark>RagA-D</mark>, <mark>LAMTOR-1 and -2</mark>, <mark>raptor</mark>, <mark>Rheb</mark> or <mark>mTOR</mark> in muscle.
The binding of <mark>mTOR</mark>, <mark>PRAS40</mark> and <mark>RagC</mark> to <mark>raptor</mark> did not differ for control and septic muscle in the basal condition; however, the Leu-induced decrease in <mark>PRAS40</mark> <mark>raptor</mark> and increase in <mark>RagC</mark> <mark>raptor</mark> seen in control muscle was absent in sepsis.
The intracellular Leu concentration was increased in septic muscle, compared to basal control conditions, and oral Leu further increased the intracellular Leu concentration similarly in both control and septic rats.
Hence, while alterations in select <mark>amino acid transporters</mark> are not associated with development of sepsis-induced Leu resistance, the Leu-stimulated binding of <mark>raptor</mark> with <mark>RagC</mark> and the recruitment of <mark>mTOR</mark>/<mark>raptor</mark> to the endosome-lysosomal compartment may partially explain the inability of Leu to fully activate <mark>mTOR</mark> and muscle protein synthesis.
<mark>CD25</mark>(+) <mark>Bcl6</mark>(low) T follicular helper cells provide help to maturing B cells in germinal centers of human tonsil.
The majority of <mark>CXCR5</mark>(+) <mark>PD1</mark>(+) <mark>CD4</mark>(+) T follicular helper (Tfh) cells (&gt;90%) are <mark>CD25</mark>(-) <mark>Bcl6</mark>(hi) , while a small subpopulation (&lt;10%) are <mark>CD25</mark>(+) <mark>Bcl6</mark>(low) but do not express <mark>FoxP3</mark> and are not T regulatory cells.
We purified T:B-cell conjugates from tonsils and found they were enriched for the <mark>CD25</mark>(+) <mark>Bcl6</mark>(low) Tfh-cell subpopulation.
In response to <mark>IL-2</mark>, these <mark>CD25</mark>(+) Tfh cells increased expression of costimulatory molecules <mark>ICOS</mark> or <mark>OX40</mark>, upregulated transcription factor <mark>cMaf</mark>, produced <mark>cytokines</mark> <mark>IL-21</mark>, <mark>IL-17</mark>, and <mark>IL-10</mark>, and raised the levels of antiapoptotic protein <mark>Bcl2</mark>.
Conjugates formed with <mark>CD25</mark>(+) <mark>BCl6</mark>(low) Tfh cells included B cells expressing higher levels of <mark>activation-induced cytidine deaminase</mark> (<mark>AID</mark>), memory marker <mark>CD45RO</mark>, surface <mark>IgG</mark> or <mark>IgA</mark>, and <mark>MHC class II</mark> compared to B-cell conjugates including <mark>CD25</mark>(-) <mark>Bcl6</mark>(hi) Tfh cells.
While <mark>IL-2</mark> suppresses early Tfh-cell differentiation, Tfh-cell recognition of antigen-presenting B cells and signaling through the <mark>T-cell receptor</mark> likely triggers expression of the high-affinity <mark>IL-2 receptor</mark> and responses to <mark>IL-2</mark> including downregulation of <mark>Bcl6</mark>.
<mark>CD25</mark> expression on Tfh cells and local production of <mark>IL-2</mark> in tonsil or lymph node may support B helper T-cell function during later stages of B-cell maturation and the development of immune memory.
<mark>Leukemia inhibitory factor</mark> protects the lung during respiratory syncytial viral infection.
BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects the lung epithelium where it stimulates the production of numerous host cytokines that are associated with disease burden and acute lung injury.
Characterizing the host cytokine response to RSV infection, the regulation of host cytokines and the impact of neutralizing an RSV-inducible cytokine during infection were undertaken in this study.
METHODS: A549, primary human small airway epithelial (SAE) cells and wild-type, <mark>TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β</mark> (<mark>Trif</mark>) and <mark>mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein</mark> (<mark>Mavs</mark>) knockout (KO) mice were infected with RSV and cytokine responses were investigated by ELISA, multiplex analysis and qPCR.
Neutralizing anti-<mark>leukemia inhibitory factor</mark> (<mark>LIF</mark>) IgG or control IgG was administered to a group of wild-type animals prior to RSV infection.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: RSV-infected A549 and SAE cells release a network of cytokines, including newly identified RSV-inducible cytokines <mark>LIF</mark>, <mark>migration inhibitory factor</mark> (<mark>MIF</mark>), <mark>stem cell factor</mark> (<mark>SCF</mark>), <mark>CCL27</<mark>CCL27,</mark> <mark>CXCL12</mark> and <mark>stem cell growth factor beta</mark> (<mark>SCGF-β</mark>).
These RSV-inducible cytokines were also observed in the airways of mice during an infection.
To identify the regulation of RSV inducible cytokines, <mark>Mavs</mark> and <mark>Trif</mark> deficient animals were infected with RSV.
In vivo induction of airway <mark>IL-1β</mark>, <mark>IL-4</mark>, <mark>IL-5</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-12</mark>(<mark>p40</mark>), <mark>IFN-γ</mark>, <mark>CCL2</mark>, <mark>CCL5</mark>, <mark>CCL3</mark>, <mark>CXCL1</mark>, <mark>IP-10</mark>/<mark>CXCL10</mark>, <mark>IL-22</mark>, <mark>MIG</mark>/<mark>CXCL9</mark> and <mark>MIF</mark> were dependent on <mark>Mavs</mark> expression in mice.
Loss of <mark>Trif</mark> expression in mice altered the RSV induction of <mark>IL-1β</mark>, <mark>IL-5</mark>, <mark>CXCL12</mark>, <mark>MIF</mark>, <mark>LIF</mark>, <mark>CXCL12</mark> and <mark>IFN-γ</mark>.
Silencing of <mark>retinoic acid-inducible gene-1</mark> (<mark>RIG-I</mark>) expression in A549 cells had a greater impact on RSV-inducible cytokines than <mark>melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5</mark> (<mark>MDA5</mark>) and <mark>laboratory of genetics and physiology 2</mark> (<mark>LGP2</mark>), and <mark>Trif</mark> expression.
To evaluate the role of <mark>LIF</mark> in the airways during RSV infection, animals were treated with neutralizing anti-<mark>LIF</mark> IgG, which enhanced RSV pathology observed with increased airspace protein content, apoptosis and airway hyperresponsiveness compared to control IgG treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: RSV infection in the epithelium induces a network of immune factors to counter infection, primarily in a <mark>RIG-I</mark> dependent manner.
Expression of <mark>LIF</mark> protects the lung from lung injury and enhanced pathology during RSV infection.
Impaired musculoskeletal response to age and exercise in <mark>PPARβ</mark>(-/-) diabetic mice.
Fragility fractures are recognized complication of diabetes, but yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.
This is particularly pronounced in type 2 diabetes in which the propensity to fall is increased but bone mass is not necessarily low.
Thus, whether factors implicated in the development of <mark>insulin</mark> resistance and diabetes directly impact on the musculoskeletal system remains to be investigated.
<mark>PPARβ</mark>(-/-) mice have reduced metabolic activity and are glucose intolerant.
We examined changes in bone and muscle in <mark>PPARβ</mark>(-/-) mice and investigated both the mechanism behind those changes with age as well as their response to exercise.
Compared with their wild type, <mark>PPARβ</mark>(-/-) mice had an accelerated and parallel decline in both muscle and bone strength with age.
These changes were accompanied by increased <mark>myostatin</mark> expression, low bone formation, and increased resorption.
In addition, mesenchymal cells from <mark>PPARβ</mark>(-/-) had a reduced proliferation capacity and appeared to differentiate into more of an adipogenic phenotype.
Concomitantly we observed an increased expression of <mark>PPARγ</mark>, characteristic of adipocytes.
The anabolic responses of muscle and bone to exercise were also diminished in <mark>PPARβ</mark>(-/-) mice.
The periosteal bone formation response to direct bone compression was, however, maintained, indicating that <mark>PPARβ</mark> controls periosteal bone formation through muscle contraction and/or metabolism.
Taken together, these data indicate that <mark>PPARβ</mark> deficiency leads to glucose intolerance, decreased muscle function, and reduced bone strength.
On a molecular level, <mark>PPARβ</mark> appears to regulate <mark>myostatin</mark> and <mark>PPARγ</mark> expression in muscle and bone, thereby providing potential new targets to reverse bone fragility in patients with metabolic disturbances.
Arabidopsis <mark>acyl-CoA-binding protein</mark> <mark>ACBP3</mark> participates in plant response to hypoxia by modulating very-long-chain fatty acid metabolism.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, <mark>acyl-CoA-binding proteins</mark> (<mark>ACBPs</mark>) are encoded by a family of six genes (<mark>ACBP1</mark> to <mark>ACBP6</mark>), and are essential for diverse cellular activities.
Recent investigations suggest that the membrane-anchored <mark>ACBPs</mark> are involved in oxygen sensing by sequestration of group VII ethylene-responsive factors under normoxia.
Here, we demonstrate the involvement of Arabidopsis <mark>ACBP3</mark> in hypoxic tolerance.
<mark>ACBP3</mark> transcription was remarkably induced following submergence under both dark (DS) and light (LS) conditions.
<mark>ACBP3</mark>-overexpressors (<mark>ACBP3</mark>-OEs) showed hypersensitivity to DS, LS and ethanolic stresses, with reduced transcription of hypoxia-responsive genes as well as accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in the rosettes.
In contrast, suppression of <mark>ACBP3</mark> in <mark>ACBP3</mark>-KOs enhanced plant tolerance to DS, LS and ethanol treatments.
By analyses of double combinations of OE-1 with <mark>npr1</mark>-5, <mark>coi1</mark>-2, <mark>ein3</mark>-1 as well as <mark>ctr1</mark>-1 mutants, we observed that the attenuated hypoxic tolerance in <mark>ACBP3</mark>-OEs was dependent on <mark>NPR1</mark>- and <mark>CTR1</mark>-mediated signaling pathways.
Lipid profiling revealed that both the total amounts and very-long-chain species of phosphatidylserine (C42:2- and C42:3-PS) and glucosylinositolphosphorylceramides (C22:0-, C22:1-, C24:0-, C24:1-, and C26:1-GIPC) were significantly lower in <mark>ACBP3</mark>-OEs but increased in <mark>ACBP3</mark>-KOs upon LS exposure.
By microscale thermophoresis analysis, the recombinant <mark>ACBP3</mark> protein bound VLC acyl-CoA esters with high affinities in vitro.
Further, a knockout mutant of <mark>MYB30</mark>, a master regulator of very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) biosynthesis, exhibited enhanced sensitivities to LS and ethanolic stresses, phenotypes that were ameliorated by <mark>ACBP3</mark>-RNAi.
Taken together, these findings suggest that Arabidopsis <mark>ACBP3</mark> participates in plant response to hypoxia by modulating VLCFA metabolism.
<mark>VPAC2</mark> (<mark>vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor type 2</mark>) receptor deficient mice develop exacerbated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with increased Th1/Th17 and reduced Th2/Treg responses.
<mark>Vasoactive intestinal peptide</mark> (<mark>VIP</mark>) and <mark>pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide</mark> (<mark>PACAP</mark>) are two structurally-related neuropeptides with widespread expression in the central and peripheral nervous systems.
Although these peptides have been repeatedly shown to exert potent anti-inflammatory actions when administered in animal models of inflammatory disease, mice deficient in <mark>VIP</mark> and <mark>PACAP</mark> were recently shown to exhibit different phenotypes (ameliorated and exacerbated, respectively) in response to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).
Therefore, elucidating what are the specific immunoregulatory roles played by each of their receptor subtypes (<mark>VPAC1</mark>, <mark>VPAC2</mark>, and <mark>PAC1</mark>) is critical.
In this study, we found that mice with a genetic deletion of <mark>VIPR2</mark>, encoding the <mark>VPAC2 receptor</mark>, exhibited exacerbated (MOG35-55)-induced EAE compared to wild type mice, characterized by enhanced clinical and histopathological features, increased <mark>proinflammatory cytokines</mark> (<mark>TNF-alpha</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IFN-gamma</mark> (Th1), and <mark>IL-17</mark> (Th17)) and reduced <mark>anti-inflammatory cytokines</mark> (<mark>IL-10</mark>, <mark>TGFbeta</mark>, and <mark>IL-4</mark> (Th2)) in the CNS and lymph nodes.
Moreover, the abundance and proliferative index of lymph node, thymus and CNS <mark>CD4</mark>(+)<mark>CD25</mark>(+)<mark>FoxP3</mark>(+) Tregs were strikingly reduced in <mark>VPAC2</mark>-deficient mice with EAE.
Finally, the in vitro suppressive activity of lymph node and splenic Tregs from <mark>VPAC2</mark>-deficient mice was impaired.
Overall, our results demonstrate critical protective roles for <mark>PACAP</mark> and the <mark>VPAC2 receptor</mark> against autoimmunity, promoting the expansion and maintenance of the Treg pool.
The <mark>Dpp</mark>/<mark>TGFb</mark>-dependent corepressor <mark>Schnurri</mark> protects epithelial cells from <mark>JNK</mark>-induced apoptosis in drosophila embryos.
<mark>Jun N-terminal kinase</mark> (<mark>JNK</mark>) often mediates apoptosis in response to cellular stress.
However, during normal development, <mark>JNK</mark> signaling controls a variety of live cell behaviors, such as during dorsal closure in Drosophila embryos.
During this process, the latent proapoptotic activity of <mark>JNK</mark> becomes apparent following <mark>Dpp</mark> signaling suppression, which leads to <mark>JNK</mark>-dependent transcriptional activation of the proapoptotic gene <mark>reaper</mark>.
<mark>Dpp</mark> signaling also protects cells from <mark>JNK</mark>-dependent apoptosis caused by epithelial disruption.
We find that repression of <mark>reaper</mark> transcription by <mark>Dpp</mark> is mediated by <mark>Schnurri</mark>.
Moreover, reporter gene analysis shows that a transcriptional regulatory module comprising <mark>AP-1</mark> and <mark>Schnurri</mark> binding sites located upstream of <mark>reaper</mark> integrate the activities of <mark>JNK</mark> and <mark>Dpp</mark>.
This arrangement allows <mark>JNK</mark> to control a migratory behavior without triggering apoptosis.
<mark>Dpp</mark> plays a dual role during dorsal closure.
It cooperates with <mark>JNK</mark> in stimulating cell migration and also prevents <mark>JNK</mark> from inducing apoptosis.
<mark>Rac1</mark> signaling is critical to cardiomyocyte polarity and embryonic heart development.
BACKGROUND: Defects in cardiac septation are the most common form of congenital heart disease, but the mechanisms underlying these defects are still poorly understood.
The <mark>small GTPase</mark> <mark>Rac1</mark> is implicated in planar cell polarity of epithelial cells in Drosophila; however, its role in mammalian cardiomyocyte polarity is not clear.
We tested the hypothesis that <mark>Rac1</mark> signaling in the second heart field regulates cardiomyocyte polarity, chamber septation, and right ventricle development during embryonic heart development.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice with second heart field-specific deficiency of <mark>Rac1</mark> (<mark>Rac1</mark>(SHF)) exhibited ventricular and atrial septal defects, a thinner right ventricle myocardium, and a bifid cardiac apex.
Fate-mapping analysis showed that second heart field contribution to the interventricular septum and right ventricle was deficient in <mark>Rac1</mark>(SHF) hearts.
Notably, cardiomyocytes had a spherical shape with disrupted <mark>F-actin</mark> filaments in <mark>Rac1</mark>(SHF) compared with elongated and well-aligned cardiomyocytes in littermate controls.
Expression of <mark>Scrib</mark>, a core protein in planar cell polarity, was lost in <mark>Rac1</mark>(SHF) hearts with decreased expression of <mark>WAVE</mark> and <mark>Arp2/3</mark>, leading to decreased migratory ability.
In addition, <mark>Rac1</mark>-deficient neonatal cardiomyocytes displayed defects in cell projections, lamellipodia formation, and cell elongation.
Furthermore, apoptosis was increased and the expression of <mark>Gata4</mark>, <mark>Tbx5</mark>, <mark>Nkx2.5</mark>, and <mark>Hand2</mark> transcription factors was decreased in the <mark>Rac1</mark>(SHF) right ventricle myocardium.
CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of <mark>Rac1</mark> in the second heart field impairs elongation and cytoskeleton organization of cardiomyocytes and results in congenital septal defects, thin right ventricle myocardium, and a bifid cardiac apex.
Our study suggests that <mark>Rac1</mark> signaling is critical to cardiomyocyte polarity and embryonic heart development.
Interruption of macrophage-derived <mark>IL-27(p28)</mark> production by <mark>IL-10</mark> during sepsis requires <mark>STAT3</mark> but not <mark>SOCS3</mark>.
Severe sepsis and septic shock are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
Infection-associated inflammation promotes the development and progression of adverse outcomes in sepsis.
The effects of heterodimeric <mark>IL-27</mark> (<mark>p28</mark>/<mark>EBI3</mark>) have been implicated in the natural course of sepsis, whereas the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of gene expression and release of <mark>IL-27</mark> in sepsis are poorly understood.
We studied the events regulating the <mark>p28</mark> subunit of IL-27 in endotoxic shock and polymicrobial sepsis following cecal ligation and puncture.
Neutralizing Abs to <mark>IL-27(p28)</mark> improved survival rates, restricted <mark>cytokine</mark> release, and reduced bacterial burden in C57BL/6 mice during sepsis.
Genetic disruption of <mark>IL-27</mark> signaling enhanced the respiratory burst of macrophages.
Experiments using splenectomized mice or treatment with clodronate liposomes suggested that macrophages in the spleen may be a significant source of <mark>IL-27(p28)</mark> during sepsis.
In cultures of <mark>TLR4</mark>-activated macrophages, the frequency of <mark>F4/80</mark>(+)<mark>CD11b</mark>(+)<mark>IL-27(p28)</mark>(+) cells was reduced by the addition of <mark>IL-10</mark>.
IL-10 antagonized both <mark>MyD88</mark>-dependent and <mark>TRIF</mark>-dependent release of <mark>IL-27(p28)</mark>.
Genetic deletion of <mark>STAT3</mark> in <mark>Tie2</mark>-<mark>Cre</mark>/<mark>STAT3</mark>flox macrophages completely interrupted the inhibition of <mark>IL-27(p28)</mark> by <mark>IL-10</mark> after <mark>TLR4</mark> activation.
In contrast, <mark>IL-10</mark> remained fully active to suppress <mark>IL-27(p28)</mark> with deletion of <mark>SOCS3</mark> in <mark>Tie2</mark>-<mark>Cre</mark>/<mark>SOCS3</mark>flox macrophages.
Blockade of <mark>IL-10R</mark> by Ab or genetic deficiency of <mark>IL-10</mark> resulted in 3-5-fold higher concentrations of <mark>IL-27(p28)</mark> in endotoxic shock and polymicrobial sepsis.
Our studies identify <mark>IL-10</mark> as a critical suppressing factor for <mark>IL-27(p28)</mark> production during infection-associated inflammation.
These findings may be helpful for a beneficial manipulation of adverse <mark>IL-27(p28)</mark> release during sepsis.
<mark>BIS</mark> targeting induces cellular senescence through the regulation of <mark>14-3-3 zeta</mark>/<mark>STAT3</mark>/<mark>SKP2</mark>/<mark>p27</mark> in glioblastoma cells.
Cellular senescence is an important mechanism for preventing tumor progression.
The elevated expression of <mark>Bcl-2-interacting cell death suppressor</mark> (<mark>BIS</mark>), an anti-apoptotic and anti-stress protein, often correlates with poor prognosis in several cancers including glioblastoma; however, the role of <mark>BIS</mark> in the regulation of senescence has not been well defined.
Here, we describe for the first time that the depletion of <mark>BIS</mark> induces G1 arrest and cellular senescence through the accumulation of <mark>p27</mark> that is independent of <mark>p53</mark>, <mark>p21</mark> or <mark>p16</mark>.
The increase in <mark>p27</mark> expression in <mark>BIS</mark>-depleted cells was attributable to an impairment of the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of <mark>p27</mark>, which was caused by a decrease in <mark>S-phase kinase-associated protein 2</mark> (<mark>SKP2</mark>) at the transcriptional level.
As an underlying molecular mechanism, we demonstrate that the loss of activity of <mark>signal transducer and activator of transcription 3</mark> (<mark>STAT3</mark>) was specifically linked to the suppression of <mark>SKP2</mark> expression.
Despite a reduction in phospho-<mark>STAT3</mark> levels, total <mark>STAT3</mark> levels were unexpectedly increased by <mark>BIS</mark> depletion, specifically in the insoluble fraction.
Our results show that <mark>14-3-3ζ</mark> expression is decreased by <mark>BIS</mark> knockdown and that <mark>14-3-3ζ</mark> depletion per se significantly induced senescence phenotypes.
In addition, the ectopic expression of <mark>14-3-3ζ</mark> blocked senescence caused by <mark>BIS</mark> depletion, which was paralleled with a decrease in insoluble <mark>STAT3</mark> in A172 glioblastoma cells.
These findings indicate that the impairment of the protein quality control conferred by <mark>BIS</mark> and/or <mark>14-3-3ζ</mark> is critical for <mark>BIS</mark> depletion-induced senescence.
Moreover, <mark>BIS</mark> knockdown also induced senescence along with an accumulation of total <mark>STAT3</mark> and <mark>p27</mark> in several different cell types as well as embryonic fibroblasts derived from <mark>Bis</mark>-knock out mice with/without variations in <mark>14-3-3ζ</mark> levels.
Therefore, our findings suggest that a downregulation of <mark>BIS</mark> expression could serve as a potential strategy for restricting tumor progression via an induction of senescence through the regulation of <mark>STAT3</mark>/<mark>SKP2</mark>/<mark>p27</mark> pathway.
Social defeat promotes a reactive endothelium in a brain region-dependent manner with increased expression of key <mark>adhesion molecules</mark>, <mark>selectins</mark> and <mark>chemokines</mark> associated with the recruitment of myeloid cells to the brain.
Repeated social defeat (RSD) in mice causes myeloid cell trafficking to the brain that contributes to the development of prolonged anxiety-like behavior.
Myeloid cell recruitment following RSD occurs in regions where neuronal and microglia activation is observed.
Thus, we hypothesized that crosstalk between neurons, microglia, and endothelial cells contributes to brain myeloid cell trafficking via chemokine signaling and vascular <mark>adhesion molecules</mark>.
Here we show that social defeat caused an exposure- and brain region-dependent increase in several key <mark>adhesion molecules</mark> and <mark>chemokines</mark> involved in the recruitment of myeloid cells.
For example, RSD induced distinct patterns of adhesion molecule expression that may explain brain region-dependent myeloid cell trafficking.
<mark>VCAM-1</mark> and <mark>ICAM-1</mark> mRNA expression were increased in an exposure-dependent manner.
Furthermore, RSD-induced <mark>VCAM-1</mark> and <mark>ICAM-1</mark> protein expression were localized to the vasculature of brain regions implicated in fear and anxiety responses, which spatially corresponded to previously reported patterns of myeloid cell trafficking.
Next, mRNA expression of additional <mark>adhesion molecules</mark> (<mark>E- and P-selectin</mark>, <mark>PECAM-1</mark>) and <mark>chemokines</mark> (<mark>CXCL1</mark>, <mark>CXCL2</mark>, <mark>CXCL12</mark>, <mark>CCL2</mark>) were determined in the brain.
Social defeat induced an exposure-dependent increase in mRNA levels of <mark>E-selectin</mark>, <mark>CXCL1</mark>, and <mark>CXCL2</mark> that increased with additional days of social defeat.
While <mark>CXCL12</mark> was unaffected by RSD, <mark>CCL2</mark> expression was increased by six days of social defeat.
Last, comparison between enriched <mark>CD11b</mark>(+) cells (microglia/macrophages) and enriched <mark>GLAST-1<mark>GLAST-1(+)</mark>/<mark>CD11b</mark>(-) cells (astrocytes) revealed RSD increased mRNA expression of <mark>IL-1β</mark>, <mark>CCL2</mark>, and <mark>CXCL2</mark> in microglia/macrophages but not in astrocytes.
Collectively, these data indicate that key mediators of leukocyte recruitment were increased in the brain vasculature following RSD in an exposure- and brain region-dependent manner.
Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells directly contribute to arteriosclerotic progression via <mark>integrin β2</mark>.
Recent studies described the association between hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) expansion in the bone marrow (BM), leukocytosis in the peripheral blood, and accelerated atherosclerosis.
We hypothesized that circulating HSPC may home to inflamed vessels, where they might contribute to inflammation and neointima formation.
We demonstrated that Lin(-) <mark>Sca-1</mark>(+) <mark>cKit</mark>(+) (LSK cells) in BM and peripheral blood of <mark>LDLr</mark>(-/-) mice on high fat diet expressed significantly more <mark>integrin β2</mark> , which was responsible for LSK cell adhesion and migration toward <mark>ICAM-1</mark> in vitro, and homing to injured arteries in vivo, all of which were blocked with an anti-<mark>CD18</mark> blocking antibody.
When homed LSK cells were isolated from ligated artery and injected to irradiated recipients, they resulted in BM reconstitution.
Injection of <mark>CD18</mark>(+/+) LSK cells to immunodeficient Balb/C <mark>Rag2</mark>(-) <mark>ɣC</mark>(-/-) recipients resulted in more severe inflammation and reinforced neointima formation in the ligated carotid artery, compared to mice injected with PBS and <mark>CD18</mark>(-/-) LSK cells.
Hypercholesterolemia stimulated <mark>ERK</mark> phosphorylation (p<mark>ERK</mark>) in LSK cells of <mark>LDLr</mark>(-/-) mice in vivo.
Blockade of p<mark>ERK</mark> reduced <mark>ARF1</mark> expression, leading to decreased <mark>integrin β2</mark> function on HSPC.
In addition, <mark>integrin β2</mark> function could be regulated via <mark>ERK</mark>-independent <mark>LRP1</mark> pathway.
<mark>Integrin β2</mark> expression on HSPC is regulated by hypercholesterolemia, specifically LDL, in p<mark>ERK</mark>-dependent and -independent manners, leading to increased homing and localization of HSPC to injured arteries, which is highly correlated with arteriosclerosis.
The <mark>androgen receptor</mark> confers protection against diet-induced atherosclerosis, obesity, and dyslipidemia in female mice.
Androgens have important cardiometabolic actions in males, but their metabolic role in females is unclear.
To determine the physiologic <mark>androgen receptor</mark> (<mark>AR</mark>)-dependent actions of androgens on atherogenesis in female mice, we generated female <mark>AR</mark>-knockout (ARKO) mice on an atherosclerosis-prone <mark>apolipoprotein E</mark> (<mark>apoE</mark>)-deficient background.
After 8 weeks on a high-fat diet, but not on a normal chow diet, atherosclerosis in aorta was increased in ARKO females (+59% vs. control <mark>apoE</mark>-deficient mice with intact <mark>AR</mark> gene).
They also displayed increased body weight (+18%), body fat percentage (+62%), and hepatic triglyceride levels, reduced insulin sensitivity, and a marked atherogenic dyslipidemia (serum cholesterol, +52%).
Differences in atherosclerosis, body weight, and lipid levels between ARKO and control mice were abolished in mice that were ovariectomized before puberty, consistent with a protective action of ovarian androgens mediated via the <mark>AR</mark>.
Furthermore, the <mark>AR</mark> agonist dihydrotestosterone reduced atherosclerosis (-41%; thoracic aorta), subcutaneous fat mass (-44%), and cholesterol levels (-35%) in ovariectomized mice, reduced hepatocyte lipid accumulation in hepatoma cells in vitro, and regulated mRNA expression of hepatic genes pivotal for lipid homeostasis.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that the <mark>AR</mark> protects against diet-induced atherosclerosis in female mice and propose that this is mediated by modulation of body composition and lipid metabolism.
<mark>MIG-7</mark> and phosphorylated <mark>prohibitin</mark> coordinately regulate lung cancer invasion/metastasis.
<mark>Growth factors</mark> and <mark>COX-2</mark>/PGE2 enhance lung cancer invasion/metastasis via <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> and <mark>RAS</mark>/<mark>Raf</mark>.
Here, we explored their mechanism of action further.
We found first that higher levels of <mark>migration inducting gene-7</mark> protein (<mark>MIG-7</mark>) and <mark>PHB</mark> phosphorylated at threonine 258 (phospho-<mark>PHB</mark>T258) are positively correlated with advanced stages of human lung cancer in tissue microarray.
PGE2 or <mark>growth factors</mark> such as <mark>EGF</mark>, <mark>HGF</mark> and <mark>IGF-1</mark> increased complex formation of phospho-<mark>PHB</mark>T258 with <mark>Ras</mark>, phospho-<mark>Akt</mark>S473, phospho-<mark>Raf-1</mark>S338, <mark>MEKK1</mark> and <mark>IKKalpha/beta</mark>S176/180 in the raft domain transiently within 1 hour and <mark>MIG-7</mark> in the cytosol 12-24 hours later.
Association of phospho-<mark>PHB</mark>T258 with <mark>MEKK1</mark> but not <mark>MEKK3</mark> activates <mark>IKK</mark>/<mark>IkappaB</mark>/<mark>NF-kappaB</mark> and <mark>MEK</mark>/<mark>ERK</mark> to increase cellular COX-2/PGE2 and an <mark>E-cadherin</mark> suppressor <mark>Snail</mark> leading to enhancement of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and lung cancer migration/invasion.
<mark>MIG-7</mark>, on the other hand, was induced by growth factors and PGE2 via <mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>GSK-3beta</mark> in a phospho-<mark>PHB</mark>T258 independent manner.
<mark>MIG-7</mark> increased two <mark>E-cadherin</mark> suppressors <mark>ZEB-1</mark> and <mark>Twist</mark> to enhance EMT and cancer migration/invasion.
Downregulating phospho-<mark>PHB</mark>T258 and <mark>MIG-7</mark> had an additive effect on attenuating lung cancer invasion/metastasis and prolonging the survival of xenograft mice.
Phospho-<mark>PHB</mark>T258 and <mark>MIG-7</mark> may thus play complementary roles in the initiation and sustainment of the effects of growth factors and COX-2/PGE2 on cancer invasion/metastasis.
Pharmacogenetic Analysis of INT 0144 Trial: Association of Polymorphisms with Survival and Toxicity in Rectal Cancer Patients Treated with 5-FU and Radiation.
PURPOSE: We tested whether 18 polymorphisms in 16 genes (<mark>GSTP1</mark>, <mark>COX2</mark>, <mark>IL10</mark>, <mark>EGFR</mark>, <mark>EGF</mark>, <mark>FGFR4</mark>, <mark>CCDN1</mark>, <mark>VEGFR2</mark>, <mark>VEGF</mark>, <mark>CXCR2</mark>, <mark>IL8</mark>, <mark>MMP3</mark>, <mark>ICAM1</mark>, <mark>ERCC1</mark>, <mark>RAD51</mark>, and <mark>XRCC3</mark>) would predict disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity in the INT0144 trial, which was designed to investigate different postoperative regimens of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiation (CRT) in locally advanced rectal cancers: Arm 1 consisted of bolus 5-FU followed by 5-FU protracted venous infusion (PVI) with radiotherapy; arm 2 was induction and concomitant PVI 5-FU with radiotherapy and arm 3 was induction and concomitant bolus 5-FU with radiotherapy.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DNA from 746 stage II/III rectal patients enrolled in the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) S9304 phase III trial was analyzed.
Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue.
The polymorphisms were analyzed using direct DNA-sequencing or polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).
RESULTS: <mark>GSTP1</mark>-Ile105Val (rs1695) was significantly associated with DFS and OS and its effect did not vary by treatment arm.
The five-year DFS and OS were 53% and 58%, respectively, for G/G, 66% and 72% for G/A, and 57% and 66% for A/A patients.
In arm 2, <mark>IL8</mark>-251A/A genotype (rs4073) was associated with a lower risk of toxicities (P = 0.04).
The <mark>VEGFR2</mark> H472Q Q/Q genotype (rs1870377) was associated with a higher risk of grade 3-5 proximal upper gastrointestinal tract (PUGIT) mucositis (P = 0.04) in arm 2.
However, in arm 1, this genotype was associated with a lower risk of PUGIT mucositis (P = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: rs1695 may be prognostic in patients with rectal cancer treated with adjuvant CRT.
rs4073 and rs1870377 may exhibit different associations with toxicity, according to the 5-FU schedule.
Expression of the potential therapeutic target <mark>CXXC5</mark> in primary acute myeloid leukemia cells - high expression is associated with adverse prognosis as well as altered intracellular signaling and transcriptional regulation.
The <mark>CXXC5</mark> gene encodes a transcriptional activator with a zinc-finger domain, and high expression in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells is associated with adverse prognosis.
We now characterized the biological context of <mark>CXXC5</mark> expression in primary human AML cells.
The global gene expression profile of AML cells derived from 48 consecutive patients was analyzed; cells with high and low <mark>CXXC5</mark> expression then showed major differences with regard to extracellular communication and intracellular signaling.
We observed significant differences in the phosphorylation status of several intracellular signaling mediators (<mark>CREB</mark>, <mark>PDK1</mark>, <mark>SRC</mark>, <mark>STAT1</mark>, <mark>p38</mark>, <mark>STAT3</mark>, <mark>rpS6</mark>) that are important for <mark>PI3K</mark>-<mark>Akt</mark>-<mark>mTOR</mark> signaling and/or transcriptional regulation.
High <mark>CXXC5</mark> expression was also associated with high mRNA expression of several stem cell-associated transcriptional regulators, the strongest associations being with <mark>WT1</mark>, <mark>GATA2</mark>, <mark>RUNX1</mark>, <mark>LYL1</mark>, <mark>DNMT3</mark>, <mark>SPI1</mark>, and <mark>MYB</mark>.
Finally, <mark>CXXC5</mark> knockdown in human AML cell lines caused significantly increased expression of the potential tumor suppressor gene <mark>TSC22</mark> and genes encoding the <mark>growth factor receptor</mark> <mark>KIT</mark>, the <mark>cytokine</mark> <mark>Angiopoietin 1</mark> and the selenium-containing glycoprotein <mark>Selenoprotein P</mark>.
Thus, high <mark>CXXC5</mark> expression seems to affect several steps in human leukemogenesis, including intracellular events as well as extracellular communication.
Nitrogen regulates <mark>AMPK</mark> to control <mark>TORC1</mark> signaling.
BACKGROUND: Cell growth and cell-cycle progression are tightly coordinated to enable cells to adjust their size (timing of division) to the demands of proliferation in varying nutritional environments.
In fission yeast, nitrogen stress results in sustained proliferation at a reduced size.
RESULTS: Here, we show that cells can sense nitrogen stress to reduce <mark>target of rapamycin complex-1</mark> (<mark>TORC1</mark>) activity.
Nitrogen-stress-induced <mark>TORC1</mark> inhibition differs from amino-acid-dependent control of <mark>TORC1</mark> and requires the <mark>Ssp2 (AMPKalpha) kinase</mark>, the <mark>Tsc1/2</mark> complex, and <mark>Rhb1 GTPase</mark>.
Importantly, the <mark>beta and gamma regulatory subunits of AMPK</mark> are not required to control cell division in response to nitrogen stress, providing evidence for a nitrogen-sensing mechanism that is independent of changes in intracellular ATP/AMP levels.
The <mark>CaMKK</mark> homolog <mark>Ssp1</mark> is constitutively required for phosphorylation of the <mark>AMPKalpha(Ssp2)</mark> T loop.
However, we find that a second homolog <mark>CaMKK(Ppk34)</mark> is specifically required to stimulate <mark>AMPKalpha(Ssp2)</mark> activation in response to nitrogen stress.
Finally, ammonia also controls <mark>mTORC1</mark> activity in human cells; <mark>mTORC1</mark> is activated upon the addition of ammonium to glutamine-starved Hep3B cancer cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The alternative nitrogen source ammonia can simulate <mark>TORC1</mark> activity to support growth and division under challenging nutrient settings, a situation often seen in cancer.
Adipogenic Differentiation of hMSCs is Mediated by Recruitment of <mark>IGF-1r</mark> Onto the Primary Cilium Associated With Cilia Elongation.
Primary cilia are single non-motile organelles that provide a highly regulated compartment into which specific proteins are trafficked as a critical part of various signaling pathways.
The absence of primary cilia has been shown to prevent differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs).
Changes in primary cilia length are crucial for regulating signaling events; however it is not known how alterations in cilia structure relate to differentiation.
This study tested the hypothesis that changes in primary cilia structure are required for stem cell differentiation.
hMSCs expressed primary cilia that were labeled with acetylated alpha tubulin and visualized by confocal microscopy.
Chemically induced differentiation resulted in lineage specific changes in cilia length and prevalence which were independent of cell cycle.
In particular, adipogenic differentiation resulted in cilia elongation associated with the presence of dexamethasone, while <mark>insulin</mark> had an inhibitory effect on cilia length.
Over a 7-day time course, adipogenic differentiation media resulted in cilia elongation within 2 days followed by increased nuclear <mark>PPARg</mark> levels; an early marker of adipogenesis.
Cilia elongation was associated with increased trafficking of <mark>insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor β</mark> (<mark>IGF-1Rβ</mark>) into the cilium.
This was reversed on inhibition of elongation by <mark>IFT-88</mark> siRNA transfection, which also decreased nuclear <mark>PPARg</mark>.
This is the first study to show that adipogenic differentiation requires primary cilia elongation associated with the recruitment of <mark>IGF-1Rβ</mark> onto the cilium.
This study may lead to the development of cilia-targeted therapies for controlling adipogenic differentiation and associated conditions such as obesity.
Inactivation of <mark>Sag</mark>/<mark>Rbx2</mark>/<mark>Roc2</mark> <mark>e3 ubiquitin ligase</mark> triggers senescence and inhibits <mark>kras</mark>-induced immortalization.
Our recent study showed that SAG/<mark>RBX2</mark> <mark>E3 ubiquitin ligase</mark> regulates apoptosis and vasculogenesis by promoting degradation of <mark>NOXA</mark> and <mark>NF1</mark>, and co-operates with <mark>Kras</mark> to promote lung tumorigenesis by activating <mark>NFkappaB</mark> and <mark>mTOR</mark> pathways via targeted degradation of tumor suppressive substrates including <mark>IkappaB</mark>, <mark>DEPTOR</mark>, <mark>p21</mark> and <mark>p27</mark>.
Here we investigated the role of <mark>Sag</mark>/<mark>Rbx2</mark> <mark>E3 ligase</mark> in cellular senescence and immortalization of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and report that <mark>Sag</mark> is required for proper cell proliferation and <mark>Kras</mark>(G12D)-induced immortalization.
<mark>Sag</mark> inactivation by genetic deletion remarkably suppresses cell proliferation by inducing senescence, which is associated with accumulation of <mark>p16</mark>, but not <mark>p53</mark>.
Mechanistically, <mark>Sag</mark> deletion caused accumulation of <mark>Jun-B</mark>, a substrate of <mark>Sag</mark>-<mark>Fbxw7</mark> <mark>E3 ligase</mark> and a <mark>transcription factor</mark> that drives <mark>p16</mark> transcription.
Importantly, senescence triggered by <mark>Sag</mark> deletion can be largely rescued by simultaneous deletion of <mark>Cdkn2a</mark>, the <mark>p16</mark> encoding gene, indicating its causal role.
Furthermore, <mark>Kras</mark>(G12D)-induced immortalization can also be abrogated by <mark>Sag</mark> deletion via senescence induction, which is again rescued by simultaneous deletion of <mark>Cdkn2a</mark>.
Finally, we found that <mark>Sag</mark> deletion inactivates <mark>Kras</mark>(G12D) activity and block the <mark>MAPK</mark> signaling pathway, together with accumulated <mark>p16</mark>, to induce senescence.
Taken together, our results demonstrated that <mark>Sag</mark> is a <mark>Kras</mark>(G12D)-cooperating oncogene required for <mark>Kras</mark>(G12D)-induced immortalization and transformation, and targeting <mark>SAG</mark>-<mark>SCF</mark> <mark>E3 ligase</mark> may, therefore, have therapeutic value for senescence-based cancer treatment.
The <mark>CB₁ cannabinoid receptor</mark> signals striatal neuroprotection via a <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>mTORC1</mark>/<mark>BDNF</mark> pathway.
The <mark>CB1 cannabinoid receptor</mark>, the main molecular target of endocannabinoids and cannabis active components, is the most abundant <mark>G protein-coupled receptor</mark> in the mammalian brain.
In particular, the <mark>CB1 receptor</mark> is highly expressed in the basal ganglia, mostly on terminals of medium-sized spiny neurons, where it plays a key neuromodulatory function.
The <mark>CB1 receptor</mark> also confers neuroprotection in various experimental models of striatal damage.
However, the assessment of the physiological relevance and therapeutic potential of the <mark>CB1 receptor</mark> in basal ganglia-related diseases is hampered, at least in part, by the lack of knowledge of the precise mechanism of <mark>CB1 receptor</mark> neuroprotective activity.
Here, by using an array of pharmacological, genetic and pharmacogenetic (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug) approaches, we show that (1) <mark>CB1 receptor</mark> engagement protects striatal cells from excitotoxic death via the <mark>phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1</mark> pathway, which, in turn, (2) induces <mark>brain-derived neurotrophic factor</mark> (<mark>BDNF</mark>) expression through the selective activation of <mark>BDNF</mark> gene promoter IV, an effect that is mediated by multiple transcription factors.
To assess the possible functional impact of the <mark>CB1</mark>/<mark>BDNF</mark> axis in a neurodegenerative-disease context in vivo, we conducted experiments in the R6/2 mouse, a well-established model of Huntington's disease, in which the <mark>CB1 receptor</mark> and <mark>BDNF</mark> are known to be severely downregulated in the dorsolateral striatum.
Adeno-associated <mark>viral vector</mark>-enforced re-expression of the <mark>CB1 receptor</mark> in the dorsolateral striatum of R6/2 mice allowed the re-expression of <mark>BDNF</mark> and the concerted rescue of the neuropathological deficits in these animals.
Collectively, these findings unravel a molecular link between <mark>CB1 receptor</mark> activation and <mark>BDNF</mark> expression, and support the relevance of the <mark>CB1</mark>/<mark>BDNF</mark> axis in promoting striatal neuron survival.
Sex-differences in renal expression of selected transporters and transcription factors in lean and obese Zucker spontaneously hypertensive fatty rats.
The aim of this study was to identify sex-dependent expression of renal transporter mRNA in lean and obese Zucker spontaneously hypertensive fatty (ZSF1) rats and to investigate the interaction of the most altered transporter, <mark>organic anion transporter 2</mark> (<mark>Oat2</mark>), with diabetes-relevant metabolites and drugs.
Higher incidence of glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and protein casts in Bowman's space and tubular lumen was detected by PAS staining in obese male compared to female ZSF1 rats.
Real-time PCR on RNA isolated from kidney cortex revealed that <mark>Sglt1-2</mark>, <mark>Oat1-3</mark>, and <mark>Oct1</mark> were higher expressed in kidneys of lean females.
<mark>Oct2</mark> and <mark>Mrp2</mark> were higher expressed in obese males.
Renal mRNA levels of transporters were reduced with diabetic nephropathy in females and the expression of transcription factors <mark>Hnf1beta</mark> and <mark>Hnf4alpha</mark> in both sexes.
The highest difference between lean and obese ZSF1 rats was found for <mark>Oat2</mark>.
Therefore, we have tested the interaction of human <mark>OAT2</mark> with various substances using tritium-labeled cGMP.
Human <mark>OAT2</mark> showed no interaction with diabetes-related metabolites, diabetic drugs, and ACE-inhibitors.
However, <mark>OAT2</mark>-dependent uptake of cGMP was inhibited by furosemide.
The strongly decreased expression of <mark>Oat2</mark> and other transporters in female diabetic ZSF1 rats could possibly impair renal drug excretion, for example, of furosemide.
Liver fibrosis occurs through dysregulation of <mark>MyD88</mark>-dependent innate B-cell activity.
Chronic liver disease mediated by activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) leads to liver fibrosis.
Here, we postulated that the immune regulatory properties of HSCs might promote the profibrogenic activity of B cells.
Fibrosis is completely attenuated in carbon tetrachloride-treated, B cell-deficient µMT mice, showing that B cells are required.
The retinoic acid produced by HSCs augmented B-cell survival, plasma cell marker <mark>CD138</mark> expression, and <mark>immunoglobulin G</mark> production.
These activities were reversed following addition of the retinoic acid inhibitor LE540.
Transcriptional profiling of fibrotic liver B cells revealed increased expression of genes related to activation of <mark>nuclear factor κ light chain enhancer of activated B cells</mark>, proinflammatory <mark>cytokine</mark> production, and <mark>CD40</mark> signaling, suggesting that these B cells are activated and may be acting as inflammatory cells.
Biological validation experiments also revealed increased activation (<mark>CD44</mark> and <mark>CD86</mark> expression), constitutive <mark>immunoglobulin G</mark> production, and secretion of the <mark>proinflammatory cytokin<mark>cytokines</mark> <mark>tumor necrosis factor-α</mark>, <mark>monocyte chemoattractant protein-1</mark>, and <mark>macrophage inflammatory protein-1α</mark>.
Likewise, targeted deletion of B-cell-intrinsic <mark>myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88</mark> signaling, an innate adaptor with involvement in retinoic acid signaling, resulted in reduced infiltration of migratory <mark>CD11c</mark>(+) dendritic cells and <mark>Ly6C</mark>(++) monocytes and, hence, reduced liver pathology.
CONCLUSION: Liver fibrosis occurs through a mechanism of HSC-mediated augmentation of innate B-cell activity.
These findings highlight B cells as important "first responders" of the intrahepatic immune environment.
<mark>Adipose triglyceride lipase</mark> is involved in the mobilization of triglyceride and retinoid stores of hepatic stellate cells.
Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) store triglycerides (TGs) and retinyl ester (RE) in cytosolic lipid droplets.
RE stores are degraded following retinoid starvation or in response to pathogenic stimuli resulting in <mark>HSC</mark> activation.
At present, the major enzymes catalyzing lipid degradation in HSCs are unknown.
In this study, we investigated whether <mark>adipose triglyceride lipase</mark> (<mark>ATGL</mark>) is involved in RE catabolism of HSCs.
Additionally, we compared the effects of <mark>ATGL</mark> deficiency and <mark>hormone-sensitive lipase</mark> (<mark>HSL</mark>) deficiency, a known <mark>RE hydrolase</mark> (<mark>REH</mark>), on RE stores in liver and adipose tissue.
We show that <mark>ATGL</mark> degrades RE even in the presence of TGs, implicating that these substrates compete for <mark>ATGL</mark> binding.
<mark>REH</mark> activity was stimulated and inhibited by <mark>comparative gene identification-58</mark> and <mark>G0/G1 switch gene-2</mark>, respectively, the physiological regulators of <mark>ATGL</mark> activity.
In cultured primary murine HSCs, pharmacological inhibition of <mark>ATGL</mark>, but not <mark>HSL</mark>, increased RE accumulation.
In mice globally lacking <mark>ATGL</mark> or <mark>HSL</mark>, RE contents in white adipose tissue were decreased or increased, respectively, while plasma retinol and liver RE levels remained unchanged.
In conclusion, our study shows that <mark>ATGL</mark> acts as <mark>REH</mark> in HSCs promoting the degradation of RE stores in addition to its established function as <mark>TG lipase</mark>.
<mark>HSL</mark> is the predominant <mark>REH</mark> in adipocytes but does not affect lipid mobilization in HSCs.
An in vivo screen to identify candidate neurogenic genes in the developing Xenopus visual system.
Neurogenesis in the brain of Xenopus laevis continues throughout larval stages of development.
We developed a 2-tier screen to identify candidate genes controlling neurogenesis in Xenopus optic tectum in vivo.
First, microarray and NanoString analyses were used to identify candidate genes that were differentially expressed in <mark>Sox2</mark>-expressing neural progenitor cells or their neuronal progeny.
Then an in vivo, time-lapse imaging-based screen was used to test whether morpholinos against 34 candidate genes altered neural progenitor cell proliferation or neuronal differentiation over 3 days in the optic tectum of intact Xenopus tadpoles.
We co-electroporated antisense morpholino oligonucleotides against each of the candidate genes with a plasmid that drives GFP expression in <mark>Sox2</mark>-expressing neural progenitor cells and quantified the effects of morpholinos on neurogenesis.
Of the 34 morpholinos tested, 24 altered neural progenitor cell proliferation or neuronal differentiation.
The candidates which were tagged as differentially expressed and validated by the in vivo imaging screen include: <mark>actn1</mark>, <mark>arl9</mark>, <mark>eif3a</mark>, <mark>elk4</mark>, <mark>ephb1</mark>, <mark>fmr1-a</mark>, <mark>fxr1-1</mark>, <mark>fbxw7</mark>, <mark>fgf2</mark>, <mark>gstp1</mark>, <mark>hat1</mark>, <mark>hspa5</mark>, <mark>lsm6</mark>, <mark>mecp2</mark>, <mark>mmp9</mark>, and <mark>prkaca</mark>.
Several of these candidates, including <mark>fgf2</mark> and <mark>elk4</mark>, have known or proposed neurogenic functions, thereby validating our strategy to identify candidates.
Genes with no previously demonstrated neurogenic functions, <mark>gstp1</mark>, <mark>hspa5</mark> and <mark>lsm6</mark>, were identified from the morpholino experiments, suggesting that our screen successfully revealed unknown candidates.
Genes that are associated with human disease, such as such as <mark>mecp2</mark> and <mark>fmr1-a</mark>, were identified by our screen, providing the groundwork for using Xenopus as an experimental system to probe conserved disease mechanisms.
Together the data identify candidate neurogenic regulatory genes and demonstrate that Xenopus is an effective experimental animal to identify and characterize genes that regulate neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation in vivo.
Loss of <mark>muscleblind-like 1</mark> results in cardiac pathology and persistence of embryonic splice isoforms.
Cardiac dysfunction is a prominent cause of mortality in myotonic dystrophy I (DM1), a disease where expanded CUG repeats bind and disable the <mark>muscleblind-like family</mark> of splice regulators.
Deletion of <mark>muscleblind-like 1</mark> (<mark>Mbnl1</mark>(ΔE2/ΔE2)) in 129 sv mice results in QRS, QTc widening, bundle block and STc narrowing at 2-4 months of age.
With time, cardiac function deteriorates further and at 6 months, decreased R wave amplitudes, sinus node dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, multi-focal myocardial fiber death and calcification manifest.
Sudden death, where no end point illness is overt, is observed at a median age of 6.5 and 4.8 months in ~67% and ~86% of male and female <mark>Mbnl1</mark>(ΔE2/ΔE2) mice, respectively.
<mark>Mbnl1</mark> depletion results in the persistence of embryonic splice isoforms in a network of cardiac RNAs, some of which have been previously implicated in DM1, regulating sodium and calcium currents, <mark>Scn5a</mark>, <mark>Junctin</mark>, <mark>Junctate</mark>, <mark>Atp2a1</mark>, <mark>Atp11a</mark>, <mark>Cacna1s</mark>, <mark>Ryr2</mark>, intra and inter cellular transport, <mark>Clta</mark>, <mark>Stx2</mark>, <mark>Tjp1</mark>, cell survival, <mark>Capn3</mark>, <mark>Sirt2</mark>, <mark>Csda</mark>, sarcomere and cytoskeleton organization and function, <mark>Trim55</mark>, <mark>Mapt</mark>, <mark>Pdlim3</mark>, <mark>Pdlim5</mark>, <mark>Sorbs1</mark>, <mark>Sorbs2</mark>, <mark>Fhod1</mark>, <mark>Spag9</mark> and structural components of the sarcomere, <mark>Myom1</mark>, <mark>Tnnt2</mark>, <mark>Zasp</mark>.
Thus this study supports a key role for <mark>Mbnl1</mark> loss in the initiation of DM1 cardiac disease.
<mark>FLT3</mark>-ITD confers resistance to the <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> pathway inhibitors by protecting the <mark>mTOR</mark>/<mark>4EBP1</mark>/<mark>Mcl-1</mark> pathway through <mark>STAT5</mark> activation in acute myeloid leukemia.
<mark>FLT3</mark>-ITD and <mark>FLT3</mark>-<mark>TKD</mark> are the most frequent <mark>tyrosine kinase</mark> mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with the former associated with poor prognosis.
Here, we show that the <mark>PI3K</mark> inhibitor GDC-0941 or the <mark>Akt</mark> inhibitor MK-2206 induced apoptosis through the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway more efficiently in hematopoietic 32D cells driven by <mark>FLT3</mark>-<mark>TKD</mark> (32D/TKD) than <mark>FLT3</mark>-ITD (32D/ITD), which robustly activated <mark>STAT5</mark>.
The resistance to GDC-0941 and MK-2206 was gained by expression of the constitutively activated <mark>STAT5</mark> mutant <mark>STAT5A</mark>1*6 in 32D/TKD cells, while it was abrogated by the <mark>STAT5</mark> inhibitor pimozide in 32D/ITD cells or <mark>FLT3</mark>-ITD-expressing human leukemic MV4-11 cells.
GDC-0941 or MK-2206 induced dephosphorylation of <mark>4EBP1</mark> more conspicuously in 32D/TKD than in 32D/ITD, which was prevented or augmented by <mark>STAT5A</mark>1*6 or pimozide, respectively, and correlated with downregulation of the <mark>eIF4E</mark>/<mark>eIF4G</mark> complex formation and <mark>Mcl-1</mark> expression.
Furthermore, exogenous expression of <mark>Mcl-1</mark> endowed resistance to GDC-0941 and MK-2206 on 32D/<mark>TKD</mark> cells.
Finally, it was confirmed in primary AML cells with <mark>FLT3</mark>-ITD that pimozide enhanced <mark>4EBP1</mark> dephosphorylation and <mark>Mcl-1</mark> downregulation to augment cytotoxicity of GDC-0941.
These data suggest that the robust <mark>STAT5</mark> activation by <mark>FLT3</mark>-ITD protects cells treated with the <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> pathway inhibitors from apoptosis by maintaining <mark>Mcl-1</mark> expression through the <mark>mTORC1</mark>/<mark>4EBP1</mark>/<mark>eIF4E</mark> pathway.
<mark>mTORC2</mark> Deficiency in Myeloid Dendritic Cells Enhances Their Allogeneic Th1 and Th17 Stimulatory Ability after <mark>TLR4</mark> Ligation In Vitro and In Vivo.
The <mark>mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin</mark> (<mark>mTOR</mark>) is a key integrative <mark>kinase</mark> that functions in two independent complexes, <mark>mTOR complex (mTORC) 1</mark> and <mark>mTORC2</mark>.
In contrast to the well-defined role of <mark>mTORC1</mark> in dendritic cells (DC), little is known about the function of <mark>mTORC2</mark>.
In this study, to our knowledge, we demonstrate for the first time an enhanced ability of <mark>mTORC2</mark>-deficient myeloid DC to stimulate and polarize allogeneic T cells.
We show that activated bone marrow-derived DC from conditional <mark>Rictor</mark>(-/-) mice exhibit lower coinhibitory <mark>B7-H1</mark> molecule expression independently of the stimulus and enhanced <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>, <mark>IL-12p70</mark>, and <mark>IL-23</mark> production following <mark>TLR4</mark> ligation.
Accordingly, <mark>TLR4</mark>-activated <mark>Rictor</mark>(-/-) DC display augmented allogeneic T cell stimulatory ability, expanding <mark>IFN-gamma</mark>(+) and <mark>IL-17</mark>(+), but not <mark>IL-10</mark>(+) or <mark>CD4</mark>(+)<mark>Foxp3</mark>(+) regulatory T cells in vitro.
A similar DC profile was obtained by stimulating <mark>Dectin-1</mark> (<mark>C-type lectin family</mark> member) on <mark>Rictor</mark>(-/-) DC.
Using novel <mark>CD11c</mark>-specific <mark>Rictor</mark>(-/-) mice, we confirm the alloreactive Th1 and Th17 cell-polarizing ability of endogenous <mark>mTORC2</mark>-deficient DC after <mark>TLR4</mark> ligation in vivo.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that proinflammatory <mark>cytokines</mark> produced by <mark>Rictor</mark>(-/-) DC after LPS stimulation are key in promoting Th1/Th17 responses.
These data establish that <mark>mTORC2</mark> activity restrains conventional DC proinflammatory capacity and their ability to polarize T cells following <mark>TLR</mark> and non-<mark>TLR</mark> stimulation.
Our findings provide new insight into the role of <mark>mTORC2</mark> in regulating DC function and may have implications for emerging therapeutic strategies that target <mark>mTOR</mark> in cancer, infectious diseases, and transplantation.
Neuroprotective effect of <mark>neuroserpin</mark> in oxygen-glucose deprivation- and reoxygenation-treated rat astrocytes in vitro.
<mark>Neuroserpin</mark> (<mark>NSP</mark>) reportedly exerts neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemic animal models and patients; however, the mechanism of protection is poorly understood.
We thus attempted to confirm neuroprotective effects of <mark>NSP</mark> on astrocytes in the ischemic state and then explored the relative mechanisms.
Astrocytes from neonatal rats were treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R).
To confirm the neuroprotective effects of <mark>NSP</mark>, we measured the cell survival rate, relative <mark>lactate dehydrogenase</mark> (<mark>LDH</mark>) release; we also performed morphological methods, namely Hoechst 33342 staining and <mark>Annexin V</mark> assay.
To explore the potential mechanisms of <mark>NSP</mark>, the release of nitric oxide (NO) and <mark>TNF-alpha</mark> related to <mark>NSP</mark> administration were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
The proteins related to the <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>, ERK1/2, and <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> pathways were investigated by Western blotting.
To verify the cause-and-effect relationship between neuroprotection and the <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> pathway, a <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> pathway inhibitor sc3060 was employed to observe the effects of <mark>NSP</mark>-induced neuroprotection.
We found that <mark>NSP</mark> significantly increased the cell survival rate and reduced <mark>LDH</mark> release in OGD/R-treated astrocytes.
It also reduced NO/<mark>TNF-alpha</mark> release.
Western blotting showed that the protein levels of p-<mark>IKKBalpha/beta</mark> and <mark>P65</mark> were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment and such effects were significantly inhibited by <mark>NSP</mark> administration.
The <mark>NSP</mark>-induced inhibition could be significantly reversed by administration of the <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> pathway inhibitor sc3060, whereas, expressions of p-<mark>ERK1</mark>, p-<mark>ERK2</mark>, and p-<mark>AKT</mark> were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment; however, their levels were unchanged by <mark>NSP</mark> administration.
Our results thus verified the neuroprotective effects of <mark>NSP</mark> in ischemic astrocytes.
The potential mechanisms include inhibition of the release of NO/<mark>TNF-alpha</mark> and repression of the <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> signaling pathways.
Our data also indicated that <mark>NSP</mark> has little influence on the <mark>MAPK</mark> and <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> pathways.
<mark>Idh1</mark> protects murine hepatocytes from endotoxin-induced oxidative stress by regulating the intracellular NADP(+)/<mark>NADPH</mark> ratio.
<mark>Isocitrate dehydrogenase-1</mark> (<mark>Idh1</mark>) is an important metabolic enzyme that produces <mark>NADPH</mark> by converting isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate.
<mark>Idh1</mark> is known to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced in cells by treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro.
Here, we used <mark>Idh1</mark>-deficient knockout (<mark>Idh1</mark> KO) mice to investigate the role of <mark>Idh1</mark> in antioxidant defense in vivo.
<mark>Idh1</mark> KO mice showed heightened susceptibility to death induced by LPS and exhibited increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines such as <mark>tumor necrosis factor-α</mark> and <mark>interleukin-6</mark>.
The serum of LPS-injected <mark>Idh1</mark> KO mice also contained elevated levels of <mark>AST</mark>, a marker of inflammatory liver damage.
Furthermore, after LPS injection, livers of <mark>Idh1</mark> KO mice showed histological evidence of elevated oxidative DNA damage compared with livers of wild-type (WT) mice.
<mark>Idh1</mark> KO livers showed a faster and more pronounced oxidative stress than WT livers.
In line with that, <mark>Idh1</mark> KO hepatocytes showed higher ROS levels and an increase in the NADP(+)/<mark>NADPH</mark> ratio when compared with hepatocytes isolated from WT mice.
These results suggest that <mark>Idh1</mark> has a physiological function in protecting cells from oxidative stress by regulating the intracellular NADP(+)/<mark>NADPH</mark> ratio.
Our findings suggest that stimulation of <mark>Idh1</mark> activity may be an effective therapeutic strategy for reducing oxidative stress during inflammatory responses, including the early stages of septic shock.
<mark>CCL20</mark> is elevated during obesity and differentially regulated by <mark>NF-κB s<mark>NF-κB</mark>ts</mark> in pancreatic β-cells.
Enhanced leukocytic infiltration into pancreatic islets contributes to inflammation-based diminutions in functional β-cell mass.
Insulitis (aka islet inflammation), which can be present in both T1DM and T2DM, is one factor influencing pancreatic β-cell death and dysfunction.
<mark>IL-1β</mark>, an inflammatory mediator in both T1DM and T2DM, acutely (within 1h) induced expression of the <mark>CCL20</mark> gene in rat and human islets and clonal β-cell lines.
Transcriptional induction of <mark>CCL20</mark> required the <mark>p65 subunit of NF-κB</mark> to replace the <mark>p50</ma<mark>p50 subunit</mark> at two functional κB sites within the <mark>CCL20</mark> proximal gene promoter.
The <mark>NF-κB p50 sub<mark>p50</mark>t</mark> prevents <mark>CCL20</mark> gene expression during unstimulated conditions and overexpression of <mark>p50</mark> reduces <mark>CCL20</mark>, but enhances <mark>cyclooxygenase-2</mark> (<mark>COX-2</mark>), transcript accumulation after exposure to <mark>IL-1β</mark>.
We also identified differential recruitment of specific co-activator molecules to the <mark>CCL20</mark> gene promoter, when compared with the <mark>CCL2</mark> and <mark>COX2</mark> genes, revealing distinct transcriptional requirements for individual <mark>NF-κB</mark> responsive genes.
Moreover, <mark>IL-1β</mark>, <mark>TNF-α</mark> and <mark>IFN-γ</mark> individually increased the expression of <mark>CCR6</mark>, the receptor for <mark>CCL20</mark>, on the surface of human neutrophils.
We further found that the <mark>chemokine</mark> <mark>CCL20</mark> is elevated in serum from both genetically obese db/db mice and in C57BL6/J mice fed a high-fat diet.
Taken together, these results are consistent with a possible activation of the <mark>CCL20</mark>-<mark>CCR6</mark> axis in diseases with inflammatory components.
Thus, interfering with this signaling pathway, either at the level of <mark>NF-κB</mark>-mediated <mark>chemokine</mark> production, or downstream receptor activation, could be a potential therapeutic target to offset inflammation-associated tissue dysfunction in obesity and diabetes.
Lower <mark>PRDM2</mark> expression is associated with dopamine-agonist resistance and tumor recurrence in prolactinomas.
BACKGROUND: Dopamine agonists (DAs) are the first-line treatment for prolactinomas, which account for 25-30% of functioning pituitary adenomas, and bromocriptine (BRC) is the only commercially available DAs in China.
However, tumors are resistant to therapy in 5-18% of patients.
METHODS: The exomes of six responsive prolactinomas and six resistant prolactinomas were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing.
RESULTS: Using stringent variant calling and filtering parameters, ten somatic variants that were mainly associated with DNA repair or protein metabolic processes were identified.
New resistant variants were identified in multiple genes including <mark>PRDM2</mark>, <mark>PRG4</mark>, <mark>MUC4</mark>, <mark>DSPP</mark>, <mark>DPCR1</mark>, <mark>RP1L1</mark>, <mark>MX2</mark>, <mark>POTEF</mark>, <mark>C1orf170</mark>, and <mark>KRTAP10-3</mark>.
The expression of these genes was then quantified by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) in 12 prolactinomas and 3 normal pituitary glands.
The mRNA levels of <mark>PRDM2</mark> were approximately five-fold lower in resistant prolactinomas than in responsive tumors (p < 0.05).
<mark>PRDM2</mark> protein levels were lower in resistant prolactinomas than in responsive tumors, as determined by Western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis (p < 0.05).
Overexpression of <mark>PRDM2</mark> upregulated <mark>dopamine receptor D2</mark> (<mark>D2DR</mark>) and inhibited the phosphorylation of <mark>ERK1/2</mark> in MMQ cells.
<mark>PRDM2</mark> showed a synergistic effect with BRC on the inhibition of <mark>prolactin</mark> (<mark>PRL</mark>) secretion and MMQ cell viability, and low <mark>PRDM2</mark> expression was associated with tumor recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: <mark>PRDM2</mark> downregulation may play a role in dopamine-agonist resistance and tumor recurrence in prolactinomas.
Identification of a unique hepatocellular carcinoma line, Li-7, with <mark>CD13</mark>(+) cancer stem cells hierarchy and population change upon its differentiation during culture and effects of sorafenib.
BACKGROUNDS: Cancer stem cell (CSC) research has highlighted the necessity of developing drugs targeting CSCs.
We investigated a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line that not only has CSC hierarchy but also shows phenotypic changes (population changes) upon differentiation of CSC during culture and can be used for screening drugs targeting CSC.
METHODS: Based on a hypothesis that the CSC proportion should decrease upon its differentiation into progenitors (population change), we tested HCC cell lines (HuH-7, Li-7, PLC/PRF/5, HLF, HLE) before and after 2 months culture for several markers (<mark>CD13</mark>, <mark>EpCAM</mark>, <mark>CD133</mark>, <mark>CD44</mark>, <mark>CD90</mark>, <mark>CD24</mark>, <mark>CD166</mark>).
Tumorigenicity was tested using nude mice.
To evaluate the CSC hierarchy, we investigated reconstructivity, proliferation, <mark>ALDH</mark> activity, spheroid formation, chemosensitivity and microarray analysis of the cell populations sorted by FACS.
RESULTS: Only Li-7 cells showed a population change during culture: the proportion of <mark>CD13</mark> positive cells decreased, while that of <mark>CD166</mark> positive cells increased.
The high tumorigenicity of the Li-7 was lost after the population change.
<mark>CD13</mark>(+)/<mark>CD166</mark>(-) cells showed slow growth and reconstructed the bulk Li-7 populations composed of <mark>CD13</mark>(+)/<mark>CD166</mark>(-), <mark>CD13</mark>(-)/<mark>CD166</mark>(-) and <mark>CD13</mark>(-)/<mark>CD166</mark>(+) fractions, whereas <mark>CD13</mark>(-)/<mark>CD166</mark>(+) cells showed rapid growth but could not reproduce any other population.
<mark>CD13</mark>(+)/<mark>CD166</mark>(-) cells showed high <mark>ALDH</mark> activity, spheroid forming ability and resistance to 5-fluorouracil.
Microarray analysis demonstrated higher expression of stemness-related genes in <mark>CD166</mark>(-) than <mark>CD166</mark>(+) fraction.
These results indicated a hierarchy in Li-7 cells, in which <mark>CD13</mark>(+)/<mark>CD166</mark>(-) and <mark>CD13</mark>(-)/<mark>CD166</mark>(+) cells serve as slow growing CSCs and rapid growing progenitors, respectively.
Sorafenib selectively targeted the <mark>CD166</mark>(-) fraction, including <mark>CD13</mark>(+) CSCs, which exhibited higher mRNA expression for <mark>FGF3</mark> and <mark>FGF4</mark>, candidate biomarkers for sorafenib.
5-fluorouracil followed by sorafenib inhibited the growth of bulk Li-7 cells more effectively than the reverse sequence or either alone.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a unique HCC line, Li-7, which not only shows heterogeneity for a <mark>CD13</mark>(+) CSC hierarchy, but also undergoes a "population change" upon CSC differentiation.
Sorafenib targeted the CSC in vitro, supporting the use of this model for screening drugs targeting the CSC.
This type of "heterogeneous, unstable" cell line may prove more useful in the CSC era than conventional "homogeneous, stable" cell lines.
Sexual Dimorphism in <mark>MAPK-Activated Protein Kinase-2</mark> (<mark>MK2</mark>) Regulation of <mark>RANKL</mark>-Induced Osteoclastogenesis in Osteoclast Progenitor Subpopulations.
Osteoclasts (OCs) are bone-resorptive cells critical for maintaining skeletal integrity through coupled bone turnover.
OC differentiation and activation requires <mark>receptor activator of NF-kB ligand</mark> (<mark>RANKL</mark>) signaling through the <mark>p38 MAPK</mark> pathway.
However the role of the <mark>p38 MAPK</mark> substrate, <mark>MAPK-activated protein kinase 2</mark> (<mark>MK2</mark>), is not clearly delineated.
Within the bone marrow exists a specific subpopulation of defined osteoclast progenitor cells (dOCPs) with surface expression of <mark>B220</mark>(-)<mark>Gr1</mark>(-)<mark>CD11b</mark>(lo/-)<mark>CD115</mark>(+) (dOCP(lo/-)).
In this study, we isolated dOCPs from male and female mice to determine sex-specific effects of <mark>MK2</mark> signaling in osteoclastogenesis (OCgen).
Male <mark>Mk2</mark>(-/-) mice display an increase in the dOCP(lo) cell population when compared to <mark>Mk2</mark>(+/+) mice, while female <mark>Mk2</mark>(-/-) and <mark>Mk2</mark>(+/+ )mice exhibit no difference.
Defined OCPs from male and female <mark>Mk2</mark>(+/+) and <mark>Mk2</mark>(-/-) bone marrow were treated with macrophage colony stimulation factor (M-CSF) and RANKL cytokines to promote OCgen.
RANKL treatment of dOCP(lo) cells stimulated <mark>p38</mark> and <mark>MK2</mark> phosphorylation.
<mark>Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase</mark> (<mark>TRAP</mark>) assays were used to quantify OC number, size, and <mark>TRAP</mark> enzyme activity post-RANKL stimulation.
<mark>MK2</mark> signaling was critical for male dOCP(lo) OCgen, yet <mark>MK2</mark> signaling regulated OCgen from female dOCP- and <mark>CD11b</mark>(hi) subpopulations as well.
The functional gene, <mark>Ctsk</mark>, was attenuated in both male and female <mark>Mk2</mark>(-/-) dOCP(lo)-derived OCs.
Conversely, <mark>MK2</mark> signaling was only critical for gene expression of pre-OC fusion genes, <mark>Oc-stamp</mark> and<mark>Tm7sf4</mark>, in male OCgen.
Therefore, these data suggest there is a sexual dimorphism in <mark>MK2</mark> signaling of OCP subpopulations.
<mark>TIPE2</mark> Inhibits Lung Cancer Growth Attributing to Promotion of Apoptosis by Regulating Some Apoptotic Molecules Expression.
Recent studies found that <mark>TIPE2</mark> was involved in cancer development.
However, little is known about <mark>TIPE2</mark> in lung cancer.
Our study aims to clarify the role of <mark>TIPE2</mark> in lung carcinogenesis.
We examined the expression of <mark>TIPE2</mark> in lung squamous cancer (LSC), small cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma (AdC) tissues and found that <mark>TIPE2</mark> expression was lost in small cell lung cancer, compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues.
Overexpression of <mark>TIPE2</mark> significantly inhibited the growth of lung cancer cell H446 in vitro and even suppressed tumor formation in vivo.
Flow cytometry analysis found <mark>TIPE2</mark> overexpression promoted apoptosis of H446.
In <mark>TIPE2</mark> over-expression cells, <mark>caspase-3</mark>, <mark>caspase-9</mark>, and <mark>Bax</mark> were significantly up-regulated while <mark>Bcl-2</mark> was down-regulated.
Moreover, coincident results were shown by immunohistochemistry in tumors from nude mice.
<mark>TIPE2</mark> inhibited the phosphorylation of <mark>Akt</mark>, while promoting the phosphorylation of <mark>P38</mark>, but had no effect on <mark>IκBα</mark> and <mark>ERK</mark> pathway.
Taken together, <mark>TIPE2</mark> promoted lung cancer cell apoptosis through affecting apoptosis-related molecules <mark>caspase-3</mark>, <mark>caspase-9</mark>, <mark>Bcl-2</mark> and <mark>Bax</mark>, possibly via regulating <mark>P38</mark> and <mark>Akt</mark> pathways, indicating that <mark>TIPE2</mark> might be a novel marker for lung cancer diagnosis and therapy.
Gastrointestinal hormones/neurotransmitters and <mark>growth factors</mark> can activate <mark>P21 activated kinase 2</mark> in pancreatic acinar cells by novel mechanisms.
<mark>P-21-activated kinases</mark> (<mark>PAKs</mark>) are <mark>serine/threonine kinases</mark> comprising six isoforms divided in two groups, group-I (<mark>PAK1-3</mark>)/group-II (<mark>PAK4-6</mark>) which play important roles in cell cytoskeletal dynamics, survival, secretion and proliferation and are activated by diverse stimuli.
However, little is known about <mark>PAKs</mark> ability to be activated by <mark>gastrointestinal (GI) hormones</mark>/<mark>neurotransmitters</mark>/<mark>growth-factors</mark>.
We used rat pancreatic acini to explore the ability of GI-hormones/neurotransmitters/<mark>growth-factors</mark> to activate <mark>Group-I-PAKs</mark> and the signaling cascades involved.
Only <mark>PAK2</mark> was present in acini.
<mark>PAK2</mark> was activated by some pancreatic <mark>growth-factors</mark> [<mark>EGF</mark>, <mark>PDGF</mark>, <mark>bFGF</mark>], by secretagogues activating <mark>phospholipase-C</mark> (<mark>PLC</mark>) [<mark>CCK</mark>, carbachol, <mark>bombesin</mark>] and by post-receptor stimulants activating <mark>PKC</mark> [TPA], but not agents only mobilizing cellular calcium or increasing cyclic AMP.
<mark>CCK</mark>-activation of <mark>PAK2</mark> required both high- and low-affinity-<mark>CCK1-receptor</mark>-state activation.
It was partially reduced by <mark>PKC</mark>- or <mark>Src</mark>-inhibition, but not with <mark>PI3K</mark>-inhibitors (wortmannin, LY294002) or thapsigargin.
IPA-3, which prevents <mark>PAK2</mark> binding to <mark>small-GTPases</mark> partially inhibited <mark>PAK2</mark>-activation, as well as reduced <mark>CCK</mark>-induced <mark>ERK1/2</mark> activation and <mark>amylase</mark> release induced by <mark>CCK</mark> or <mark>bombesin</mark>.
This study demonstrates pancreatic acini, possess only one <mark>Group-I-PAK</mark>, <mark>PAK2</mark>.
<mark>CCK</mark> and other <mark>GI-hormones</mark>/<mark>neurotransmitters</mark>/<mark>growth-factors</mark> activate <mark>PAK2</mark> via <mark>small GTPases</mark> (<mark>CDC42</mark>/<mark>Rac1</mark>), <mark>PKC</mark> and <mark>SFK</mark> but not cytosolic calcium or <mark>PI3K</mark>.
<mark>CCK</mark>-activation of <mark>PAK2</mark> showed several novel features being dependent on both receptor-activation states, having <mark>PLC</mark>- and <mark>PKC</mark>-dependent/independent components and <mark>small-GTPase</mark>-dependent/independent components.
These results show that <mark>PAK2</mark> is important in signaling cascades activated by numerous pancreatic stimuli which mediate their various physiological/pathophysiological responses and thus could be a promising target for the development of therapies in some pancreatic disorders such as pancreatitis.
Inhibition of <mark>LDHA</mark> suppresses tumor progression in prostate cancer.
A key hallmark of cancer cells is their altered metabolism, known as Warburg effect.
<mark>Lactate dehydrogenase A</mark> (<mark>LDHA</mark>) executes the final step of aerobic glycolysis and has been reported to be involved in the tumor progression.
However, the function of <mark>LDHA</mark> in prostate cancer has not been studied.
In current study, we observed overexpression of <mark>LDHA</mark> in the clinical prostate cancer samples compared with benign prostate hyperplasia tissues as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and real-time qPCR.
Attenuated expression of <mark>LDHA</mark> by siRNA or inhibition of <mark>LDHA</mark> activities by FX11 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis of PC-3 and DU145 cells.
Mechanistically, decreased Warburg effect as demonstrated by reduced glucose consumption and lactate secretion and reduced expression of <mark>MMP-9</mark>, <mark>PLAU</mark>, and <mark>cathepsin B</mark> were found after <mark>LDHA</mark> knockdown or FX11 treatment in PC-3 and DU145 cells.
Taken together, our study revealed the oncogenic role of <mark>LDHA</mark> in prostate cancer and suggested that <mark>LDHA</mark> might be a potential therapeutic target.
The Arabidopsis thaliana <mark>elongator complex subunit 2</mark> epigenetically affects root development.
The <mark>elongator complex subunit 2</mark> (<mark>ELP2</mark>) protein, one subunit of an evolutionarily conserved <mark>histone acetyltransferase</mark> complex, has been shown to participate in leaf patterning, plant immune and abiotic stress responses in Arabidopsis thaliana.
Here, its role in root development was explored.
Compared to the wild type, the <mark>elp2</mark> mutant exhibited an accelerated differentiation of its root stem cells and cell division was more active in its quiescent centre (QC).
The key transcription factors responsible for maintaining root stem cell and QC identity, such as <mark>AP2 transcription factors</mark> <mark>PLT1</mark> (<mark>PLETHORA1</mark>) and <mark>PLT2</mark> (<mark>PLETHORA2</mark>), <mark>GRAS transcription factors</mark> such as <mark>SCR</mark> (<mark>SCARECROW</mark>) and <mark>SHR</mark> (<mark>SHORT ROOT</mark>) and <mark>WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX5 transcription factor</mark> <mark>WOX5</mark>, were all strongly down-regulated in the mutant.
On the other hand, expression of the G2/M transition activator <mark>CYCB1</mark> was substantially induced in <mark>elp2</mark>.
The <mark>auxin efflux transporters</mark> <mark>PIN1</mark> and <mark>PIN2</mark> showed decreased protein levels and <mark>PIN1</mark> also displayed mild polarity alterations in <mark>elp2</mark>, which resulted in a reduced auxin content in the root tip.
Either the acetylation or methylation level of each of these genes differed between the mutant and the wild type, suggesting that the <mark>ELP2</mark> regulation of root development involves the epigenetic modification of a range of transcription factors and other developmental regulators.
<mark>Leptin</mark> activation of <mark>mTOR</mark> pathway in intestinal epithelial cell triggers lipid droplet formation, <mark>cytokine</mark> production and increased cell proliferation.
Accumulating evidence suggests that obesity and enhanced inflammatory reactions are predisposing conditions for developing colon cancer.
Obesity is associated with high levels of circulating <mark>leptin</mark>.
<mark>Leptin</mark> is an <mark>adipocytokine</mark> that is secreted by adipose tissue and modulates immune response and inflammation.
Lipid droplets (LD) are organelles involved in lipid metabolism and production of inflammatory mediators, and increased numbers of LD were observed in human colon cancer.
<mark>Leptin</mark> induces the formation of LD in macrophages in a <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark> pathway-dependent manner.
Moreover, the <mark>mTOR</mark> is a <mark>serine/threonine kinase</mark> that plays a key role in cellular growth and is frequently altered in tumors.
We therefore investigated the role of <mark>leptin</mark> in the modulation of <mark>mTOR</mark> pathway and regulation of lipid metabolism and inflammatory phenotype in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6 cells).
We show that <mark>leptin</mark> promotes a dose- and time-dependent enhancement of LD formation.
The biogenesis of LD was accompanied by enhanced <mark>CXCL1</mark>/<mark>CINC-1</mark>, <mark>CCL2</mark>/<mark>MCP-1</mark> and <mark>TGF-β</mark> production and increased <mark>COX-2</mark> expression in these cells.
We demonstrated that <mark>leptin</mark>-induced increased phosphorylation of <mark>STAT3</mark> and <mark>AKT</mark> and a dose and time-dependent <mark>mTORC</mark> activation with enhanced phosphorilation of the downstream protein <mark>P70S6K</mark> protein.
Pre-treatment with rapamycin significantly inhibited <mark>leptin</mark> effects in LD formation, <mark>COX-2</mark> and <mark>TGF-β</mark> production in IEC-6 cells.
Moreover, <mark>leptin</mark> was able to stimulate the proliferation of epithelial cells on a <mark>mTOR</mark>-dependent manner.
We conclude that <mark>leptin</mark> regulates lipid metabolism, <mark>cytokine</mark> production and proliferation of intestinal cells through a mechanism largely dependent on activation of the <mark>mTOR</mark> pathway, thus suggesting that <mark>leptin</mark>-induced <mark>mTOR</mark> activation may contribute to the obesity-related enhanced susceptibility to colon carcinoma.
Transmembrane-Bound <mark>IL-15</mark>-Promoted Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Renal Cancer Cells Requires the <mark>Src</mark>-Dependent <mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>GSK-3beta</mark>/<mark>beta-Catenin</mark> Pathway.
Intrarenal <mark>interleukin-15</mark> (<mark>IL-15</mark>) plays a major role controlling epithelial survival and polarization both in physiological and pathologic conditions.
Herein, we confirmed that human renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) express a membrane-bound <mark>IL-15</mark> isoform displaying an unusual molecular weight of 27 kDa.
Its stimulation with soluble <mark>IL-15 receptor alpha</mark> chain (s-<mark>IL-15Ralpha</mark>) triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process as shown by the down-regulation of <mark>E-cadherin</mark> and <mark>zona occludens 1</mark> and the up-regulation of <mark>vimentin</mark> and <mark>N-cadherin</mark> and promotes the migratory and invasive properties of RCC.
S-<mark>IL-15Ralpha</mark> treatment triggered the <mark>Src</mark>/<mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>GSK-3beta</mark> pathway and promoted <mark>beta-catenin</mark> nuclei translocation.
Deactivation of this pathway by using <mark>Src</mark>-specific inhibitor PP2, <mark>PI3K</mark> inhibitor LY294002, and <mark>AKT</mark> inhibitor MK2206 hampered <mark>beta-catenin</mark> nuclei translocation and suppressed EMT, migration, and invasion of RCC.
S-<mark>IL-15Ralpha</mark> treatment also enhanced <mark>Src</mark>-dependent phosphorylation of <mark>focal adhesion kinase</mark> (<mark>FAK</mark>) and <mark>extracellular signal-regulated kinase</mark> (<mark>Erk1/2</mark>).
<mark>FAK</mark> knockdown significantly decreased the migration and invasion of RCC, which suggest that <mark>Src</mark>-<mark>FAK</mark> signaling was involved in s-<mark>IL-15Ralpha</mark>-favored migration and invasion of RCC.
At the same time, inhibitors of <mark>Erk1/2</mark> also significantly decreased the migration and invasion of RCC but could not reverse s-<mark>IL-15Ralpha</mark>-induced EMT.
Taken together, our results reveal that <mark>Src</mark>-dependent <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>GSK3b</mark>/<mark>beta-catenin</mark> pathway is required for s-<mark>IL-15Ra</mark>-dependent induction of EMT in RCC, while <mark>Src</mark>-<mark>FAK</mark> and <mark>Src</mark>-<mark>Erk1/2</mark> signaling were involved in s-<mark>IL-15Ralpha</mark>-promoted migration and invasion properties of RCC.
Our study provides a better understanding of <mark>IL-15</mark> signaling in RCC tumor progression, which may lead to novel targeted therapies and provide some suggestions when using <mark>IL-15</mark> in clinic.
The <mark>autotaxin</mark>-<mark>LPA2</mark> <mark>GPCR</mark> axis is modulated by gamma-irradiation and facilitates DNA damage repair.
In this study we characterized the effects of radiation injury on the expression and function of the <mark>autotaxin</mark> (<mark>ATX</mark>)-<mark>LPA2</mark> <mark>GPCR</mark> axis.
In IEC-6 crypt cells and jejunum enteroids quantitative RT-PCR showed a time- and dose-dependent upregulation of <mark>lpa2</mark> in response to gamma-irradiation that was abolished by mutation of the <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> site in the <mark>lpa2</mark> promoter or by inhibition of <mark>ATM/ATR kinases</mark> with CGK-733, suggesting that <mark>lpa2</mark> is a DNA damage response gene upregulated by <mark>ATM</mark> via <mark>NF-kappaB</mark>.
The resolution kinetics of the DNA damage marker <mark>gamma-H2AX</mark> in <mark>LPA</mark>-treated IEC-6 cells exposed to gamma-irradiation was accelerated compared to vehicle, whereas pharmacological inhibition of <mark>LPA2</mark> delayed the resolution of <mark>gamma-H2AX</mark>.
In <mark>LPA2</mark>-reconstituted MEF cells lacking <mark>LPA1&amp;3</mark> the levels of <mark>gamma-H2AX</mark> decreased rapidly, whereas in Vector MEF were high and remained sustained.
Inhibition of <mark>ERK1&amp;2</mark> or <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>AKT</mark> signaling axis by pertussis toxin or the C311A/C314A/L351A mutation in the C-terminus of <mark>LPA2</mark> abrogated the effect of <mark>LPA</mark> on DNA repair.
<mark>LPA2</mark> transcripts in <mark>Lin</mark>(-)<mark>Sca-1</mark>(+)<mark>c-Kit</mark>(+) enriched for bone marrow stem cells were 27- and 5-fold higher than in common myeloid or lymphoid progenitors, respectively.
Furthermore, after irradiation higher residual <mark>gamma-H2AX</mark> levels were detected in the bone marrow or jejunum of irradiated <mark>LPA2</mark>-KO mice compared to WT mice.
We found that gamma-irradiation increases plasma <mark>ATX</mark> activity and <mark>LPA</mark> level that is in part due to the previously established radiation-induced upregulation of <mark>TNFalpha</mark>.
These findings identify <mark>ATX</mark> and <mark>LPA2</mark> as radiation-regulated genes that appear to play a physiological role in DNA repair.
Cutting Edge: Dual Function of <mark>PPARγ</mark> in <mark>CD11c</mark>+ Cells Ensures Immune Tolerance in the Airways.
The respiratory tract maintains immune homeostasis despite constant provocation by environmental Ags.
Failure to induce tolerogenic responses to allergens incites allergic inflammation.
Despite the understanding that APCs have a crucial role in maintaining immune tolerance, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
Using mice with a conditional deletion of <mark>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ</mark> (<mark>PPARγ</mark>) in <mark>CD11c</mark>(+) cells, we show that <mark>PPARγ</mark> performs two critical functions in <mark>CD11c</mark>(+) cells to induce tolerance, thereby preserving immune homeostasis.
First, <mark>PPARγ</mark> was crucial for the induction of <mark>retinaldehyde dehydrogenase</mark> (<mark>aldh1a2</mark>) selectively in <mark>CD103</mark>(+) dendritic cells, which we recently showed promotes <mark>Foxp3</mark> expression in naive <mark>CD4</mark>(+) T cells.
Second, in all <mark>CD11c</mark>(+) cells, <mark>PPARγ</mark> was required to suppress expression of the Th17-skewing cytokines <mark>IL-6</mark> and <mark>IL-23p19</mark>.
Also, lack of <mark>PPARγ</mark> in <mark>CD11c</mark>(+) cells induced <mark>p38 MAPK</mark> activity, which was recently linked to Th17 development.
Thus, <mark>PPARγ</mark> favors immune tolerance by promoting regulatory T cell generation and blocking Th17 differentiation.
Nitric oxide stress and activation of <mark>AMP-activated protein kinase</mark> impair beta-cell <mark>sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2b</mark> activity and protein stability.
The <mark>sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase 2b</mark> (<mark>SERCA2b</mark>) pump maintains a steep Ca(2+) concentration gradient between the cytosol and ER lumen in the pancreatic beta-cell, and the integrity of this gradient has a central role in regulated <mark>insulin</mark> production and secretion, maintenance of ER function and beta-cell survival.
We have previously demonstrated loss of beta-cell <mark>SERCA2b</mark> expression under diabetic conditions.
To define the mechanisms underlying this, INS-1 cells and rat islets were treated with the proinflammatory <mark>cytokine</mark> <mark>interleukin-1beta</mark> (<mark>IL-1beta</mark>) combined with or without cycloheximide or actinomycin D. <mark>IL-1beta</mark> treatment led to increased <mark>inducible nitric oxide synthase</mark> (<mark>iNOS</mark>) gene and protein expression, which occurred concurrently with the activation of <mark>AMP-activated protein kinase</mark> (<mark>AMPK</mark>).
<mark>IL-1beta</mark> led to decreased <mark>SERCA2b</mark> mRNA and protein expression, whereas time-course experiments revealed a reduction in protein half-life with no change in mRNA stability.
Moreover, <mark>SERCA2b</mark> protein but not mRNA levels were rescued by treatment with the <mark>NOS</mark> inhibitor l-NMMA (NG-monomethyl L-arginine), whereas the NO donor SNAP (S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine) and the <mark>AMPK</mark> activator AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide) recapitulated the effects of <mark>IL-1beta</mark> on <mark>SERCA2b</mark> protein stability.
Similarly, <mark>IL-1beta</mark>-induced reductions in <mark>SERCA2b</mark> expression were rescued by pharmacological inhibition of <mark>AMPK</mark> with compound C or by transduction of a dominant-negative form of <mark>AMPK</mark>, whereas beta-cell death was prevented in parallel.
Finally, to determine a functional relationship between NO and <mark>AMPK</mark> signaling and <mark>SERCA2b</mark> activity, fura-2/AM (fura-2-acetoxymethylester) Ca(2+) imaging experiments were performed in INS-1 cells.
Consistent with observed changes in <mark>SERCA2b</mark> expression, <mark>IL-1beta</mark>, SNAP and AICAR increased cytosolic Ca(2+) and decreased ER Ca(2+) levels, suggesting congruent modulation of <mark>SERCA</mark> activity under these conditions.
In aggregate, these results show that <mark>SERCA2b</mark> protein stability is decreased under inflammatory conditions through NO- and <mark>AMPK</mark>-dependent pathways and provide novel insight into pathways leading to altered beta-cell calcium homeostasis and reduced beta-cell survival in diabetes.
<mark>MAPK</mark> signaling downstream to <mark>TLR4</mark> contributes to paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy.
<mark>Toll-like receptor 4</mark> (<mark>TLR4</mark>) has been implicated as a locus for initiation of paclitaxel related chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).
This project explores the involvement of the immediate down-stream signal molecules in inducing paclitaxel CIPN.
<mark>Mitogen-activated protein kinases</mark> (<mark>MAPKs</mark>) and <mark>nuclear factor-kappaB</mark> (<mark>NFkappaB</mark>) were measured in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the spinal cord over time using Western blot and immunohistochemistry in a rat model of paclitaxel CIPN.
The effects of <mark>MAPK</mark> inhibitors in preventing and reversing behavioral signs of CIPN were also measured (group sizes 4-9).
<mark>Extracellular signal related kinase</mark> (<mark>ERK1/2</mark>) and <mark>P38</mark> but not <mark>c-Jun N terminal kinase</mark> (<mark>JNK</mark>) or <mark>PI3K</mark>-<mark>Akt</mark> signaling expression was increased in DRG.
Phospho-<mark>ERK1/2</mark> staining was co-localized to small <mark>CGRP</mark>-positive DRG neurons in cell profiles surrounding large DRG neurons consistent with satellite glial cells.
The expression of phospho-<mark>P38</mark> was co-localized to small IB4-positive and <mark>CGRP</mark>-positive DRG neurons.
The <mark>TLR4</mark> antagonist LPS derived from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (LPS-RS) inhibited paclitaxel-induced phosphorylation of <mark>ERK1/2</mark> and <mark>P38</mark>.
The <mark>MAPK</mark> inhibitors PD98059 (<mark>MEK1/2</mark>), U0126 (<mark>MEK1/2</mark>) and SB203580 (<mark>P38</mark>) prevented but did not reverse paclitaxel-induced behavioral hypersensitivity.
Paclitaxel treatment resulted in phosphorylation of <mark>Inhibitor alpha of NFkappaB</mark> (<mark>IkappaBalpha</mark>) in DRG resulting in an apparent release of <mark>NFkappaB</mark> from the <mark>IkappaBalpha</mark>-<mark>NFkappaB</mark> complex as increased expression of nuclear <mark>NFkappaB</mark> was also observed.
LPS-RS inhibited paclitaxel-induced translocation of <mark>NFkappaB</mark> in DRG.
No change was observed in spinal <mark>NFkappaB</mark>.
These results implicate <mark>TLR4</mark> signaling via <mark>MAP kinases</mark> and <mark>NFkappaB</mark> in the induction and maintenance of paclitaxel-related CIPN.
Role of stress-activated <mark>OCT4A</mark> in the cell fate decisions of embryonal carcinoma cells treated with etoposide.
Tumor cellular senescence induced by genotoxic treatments has recently been found to be paradoxically linked to the induction of "stemness." This observation is critical as it directly impinges upon the response of tumors to current chemo-radio-therapy treatment regimens.
Previously, we showed that following etoposide (ETO) treatment embryonal carcinoma PA-1 cells undergo a <mark>p53</mark>-dependent upregulation of <mark>OCT4A</mark> and <mark>p21Cip1</mark> (governing self-renewal and regulating cell cycle inhibition and senescence, respectively).
Here we report further detail on the relationship between these and other critical cell-fate regulators.
PA-1 cells treated with ETO display highly heterogeneous increases in <mark>OCT4A</mark> and <mark>p21Cip1</mark> indicative of dis-adaptation catastrophe.
Silencing <mark>OCT4A</mark> suppresses <mark>p21Cip1</mark>, changes cell cycle regulation and subsequently suppresses terminal senescence; <mark>p21Cip1</mark>-silencing did not affect <mark>OCT4A</mark> expression or cellular phenotype.
<mark>SOX2</mark> and <mark>NANOG</mark> expression did not change following ETO treatment suggesting a dissociation of <mark>OCT4A</mark> from its pluripotency function.
Instead, ETO-induced <mark>OCT4A</mark> was concomitant with activation of <mark>AMPK</mark>, a key component of metabolic stress and autophagy regulation.
<mark>p16ink4a</mark>, the inducer of terminal senescence, underwent autophagic sequestration in the cytoplasm of ETO-treated cells, allowing alternative cell fates.
Accordingly, failure of autophagy was accompanied by an accumulation of <mark>p16ink4a</mark>, nuclear disintegration, and loss of cell recovery.
Together, these findings imply that <mark>OCT4A</mark> induction following DNA damage in PA-1 cells, performs a cell stress, rather than self-renewal, function by moderating the expression of <mark>p21Cip1</mark>, which alongside <mark>AMPK</mark> helps to then regulate autophagy.
Moreover, this data indicates that exhaustion of autophagy, through persistent DNA damage, is the cause of terminal cellular senescence.
Two Distinct <mark>Cdc2</mark> Pools Regulate Cell Cycle Progression and the DNA Damage Response in the Fission Yeast S.pombe.
The activity of <mark>Cdc2</mark> (<mark>CDK1</mark>) kinase, which coordinates cell cycle progression and DNA break repair, is blocked upon its phosphorylation at tyrosine 15 (Y15) by <mark>Wee1</mark> kinase in the presence of DNA damage.
How <mark>Cdc2</mark> can support DNA repair whilst being inactivated by the DNA damage checkpoint remains to be explained.
Human <mark>CDK1</mark> is phosphorylated by <mark>Myt1</mark> kinase at threonine 14 (T14) close to its ATP binding site before being modified at threonine 161 (T167Sp) in its T-loop by the <mark>CDK-activating kinase</mark> (<mark>CAK</mark>).
While modification of T161 promotes association with the cyclin partner, phosphorylation of T14 inhibits the <mark>CDK1</mark>-<mark>cyclin</mark> complex.
This inhibition is further enforced by the modification of Y15 by <mark>Wee1</mark> in the presence of DNA lesions.
In S.pombe, the dominant inhibition of <mark>Cdc2</mark> is provided by the phosphorylation of Y15 and only a small amount of <mark>Cdc2</mark> is modified at T14 when cells are in S phase.
Unlike human cells, both inhibitory modifications are executed by <mark>Wee1</mark>.
Using the novel IEFPT technology, which combines isoelectric focusing (IEF) with Phos-tag SDS electrophoresis (PT), we report here that S.pombe <mark>Cdc2</mark> kinase exists in seven forms.
While five forms are phosphorylated, two species are not.
Four phospho-forms associate with <mark>cyclin B</mark> (<mark>Cdc13</mark>) of which only two are modified at Y15 by <mark>Wee1</mark>.
Interestingly, only one Y15-modified species carries also the T14 modification.
The fifth phospho-form has a low affinity for <mark>cyclin B</mark> and is neither Y15 nor T14 modified.
The two unphosphorylated forms may contribute directly to the DNA damage response as only they associate with the DNA damage <mark>checkpoint kinase</mark> <mark>Chk1</mark>.
Interestingly, <mark>cyclin B</mark> is also present in the unphosphorylated pool.
We also show that the G146D mutation in <mark>Cdc2</mark>.1w, which renders <mark>Cdc2</mark> insensitive to <mark>Wee1</mark> inhibition, is aberrantly modified in a <mark>Wee1</mark>-dependent manner.
In conclusion, our work adds support to the idea that two distinct <mark>Cdc2</mark> pools regulate cell cycle progression and the response to DNA damage.
Serum levels of <mark>chemokines</mark> <mark>CCL4</mark> and <mark>CCL5</mark> in cirrhotic patients indicate the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma.
BACKGROUND: Most hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are diagnosed at an advanced stage.
The prognostic value of serum tumour markers <mark>alpha-fetoprotein</mark> (<mark>AFP</mark>) and <mark>des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin</mark> (<mark>DCP</mark>) is limited.
The aim of our study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of serum growth factors, apoptotic and inflammatory mediators of cirrhotic patients with and without HCC.
METHODS: Serum samples were collected from cirrhotic potential liver transplant patients (LTx) with (n=61) and without HCC (n=78) as well as from healthy controls (HCs; n=39).
Serum concentrations of <mark>CRP</mark>, neopterin and <mark>IL-6</mark> as markers of inflammation and <mark>thrombopoietin</mark> (<mark>TPO</mark>), <mark>GCSF</mark>, <mark>FGF basic</mark> and <mark>VEGF</mark>, <mark>HMGB1</mark>, <mark>CK-18</mark> (M65) and <mark>CK18</mark> fragment (M30) and a panel of proinflammatory <mark>chemokines</mark> (<mark>CCL2</mark>, <mark>CCL3</mark>, <mark>CCL4</mark>, <mark>CCL5</mark>, <mark>CXCL5</mark> and <mark>IL-8</mark>) were measured.
Chi square, Fisher exact, Mann-Whitney U-tests, ROC curve analysis and forward stepwise logistic regression analyses were applied.
RESULTS: Patients with HCC had higher serum <mark>TPO</mark> and <mark>chemokines</mark> (P&lt;0.001 for <mark>TPO</mark>, <mark>CCL4</mark>, <mark>CCL5</mark> and <mark>CXCL5</mark>) and lower <mark>CCL2</mark> (P=0.008) levels than cirrhotic patients without HCC.
Multivariate forward stepwise regression analysis for significant parameters showed that among the studied parameters <mark>CCL4</mark> and <mark>CCL5</mark> (P=0.001) are diagnostic markers of HCC.
Serum levels of <mark>TPO</mark> and <mark>chemokines</mark> were lower, whereas M30 was significantly higher in cirrhotic patients than in HCs.
CONCLUSIONS: High serum levels of inflammatory <mark>chemokines</mark> such as <mark>CCL4</mark> and <mark>CCL5</mark> in the serum of cirrhotic patients indicate the presence of HCC.
Putative Prostate Cancer Risk SNP in an <mark>Androgen Receptor</mark>-Binding Site of the <mark>Melanophilin</mark> Gene Illustrates Enrichment of Risk SNPs in <mark>Androgen Receptor</mark> Target Sites.
Genome-wide association studies have identified genomic loci, whose single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) predispose to prostate cancer (PCa).
However, the mechanisms of most of these variants are largely unknown.
We integrated chromatin-immunoprecipitation-coupled sequencing and microarray expression profiling in <mark>TMPRSS2</mark>-<mark>ERG</mark> gene rearrangement positive DUCaP cells with the GWAS PCa risk SNPs catalog to identify disease susceptibility SNPs localized within functional <mark>androgen receptor</mark>-binding sites (ARBSs).
Among the 48 GWAS index risk SNPs and 3,917 linked SNPs, 80 were found located in ARBSs.
Of these, rs11891426:T>G in an intron of the <mark>melanophilin</mark> gene (<mark>MLPH</mark>) was within a novel putative auxiliary <mark>AR</mark>-binding motif, which is enriched in the neighborhood of canonical androgen-responsive elements.
T→G exchange attenuated the transcriptional activity of the ARBS in an <mark>AR</mark> reporter gene assay.
The expression of <mark>MLPH</mark> in primary prostate tumors was significantly lower in those with the G compared with the T allele and correlated significantly with <mark>AR</mark> protein.
Higher <mark>melanophilin</mark> level in prostate tissue of patients with a favorable PCa risk profile points out a tumor-suppressive effect.
These results unravel a hidden link between <mark>AR</mark> and a functional putative PCa risk SNP, whose allele alteration affects androgen regulation of its host gene <mark>MLPH</mark>.
<mark>Hedgehog</mark> signaling mediates woven bone formation and vascularization during stress fracture healing.
<mark>Hedgehog</mark> (<mark>Hh</mark>) signaling is critical in developmental osteogenesis, and recent studies suggest it may also play a role in regulating osteogenic gene expression in the post-natal setting.
However, there is a void of studies directly assessing the effect of <mark>Hh</mark> inhibition on post-natal osteogenesis.
This study utilized a cyclic loading-induced ulnar stress fracture model to evaluate the hypothesis that <mark>Hh</mark> signaling contributes to osteogenesis and angiogenesis during stress fracture healing.
Immediately prior to loading, adult rats were given GDC-0449 (Vismodegib - a selective <mark>Hh</mark> pathway inhibitor; 50mg/kg orally twice daily), or vehicle.
<mark>Hh</mark> signaling was upregulated in response to stress fracture at 3 days (<mark>Ptch1</mark>, <mark>Gli1</mark> expression), and was markedly inhibited by GDC-0449 at 1 day and 3 days in the loaded and non-loaded ulnae.
GDC-0449 did not affect <mark>Hh</mark> ligand expression (<mark>Shh</mark>, <mark>Ihh</mark>, <mark>Dhh</mark>) at 1 day, but decreased <mark>Shh</mark> expression by 37% at 3 days.
GDC-0449 decreased woven bone volume (-37%) and mineral density (-17%) at 7 days.
Dynamic histomorphometry revealed that the 7 day callus was composed predominantly of woven bone in both groups.
The observed reduction in woven bone occurred concomitantly with decreased expression of <mark>Alpl</mark> and <mark>Ibsp</mark>, but was not associated with differences in early cellular proliferation (as determined by callus PCNA staining at 3 days), osteoblastic differentiation (<mark>Osx</mark> expression at 1 day and 3 days), chondrogenic gene expression (<mark>Acan</mark>, <mark>Sox9</mark>, and <mark>Col2alpha1</mark> expression at 1 day and 3 days), or bone resorption metrics (callus TRAP staining at 3 days, <mark>Rankl</mark> and <mark>Opg</mark> expression at 1 day and 3 days).
To evaluate angiogenesis, <mark>vWF</mark> immunohistochemistry showed that GDC-0449 reduced fracture callus blood vessel density by 55% at 3 days, which was associated with increased <mark>Hif1alpha</mark> gene expression (+30%).
Dynamic histomorphometric analysis demonstrated that GDC-0449 also inhibited lamellar bone formation.
Lamellar bone analysis of the loaded limb (directly adjacent to the woven bone callus) showed that GDC-0449 significantly decreased mineral apposition rate (MAR) and bone formation rate (BFR/BS) (-17% and -20%, respectively).
Lamellar BFR/BS in the non-loaded ulna was also significantly decreased (-37%), indicating that <mark>Hh</mark> signaling was required for normal bone modeling.
In conclusion, <mark>Hh</mark> signaling plays an important role in post-natal osteogenesis in the setting of stress fracture healing, mediating its effects directly through regulation of bone formation and angiogenesis.
The impact of <mark>PPARα</mark> activation on whole genome gene expression in human precision cut liver slices.
BACKGROUND: Studies in mice have shown that <mark>PPARα</mark> is an important regulator of lipid metabolism in liver and key transcription factor involved in the adaptive response to fasting.
However, much less is known about the role of <mark>PPARα</mark> in human liver.
METHODS: Here we set out to study the function of <mark>PPARα</mark> in human liver via analysis of whole genome gene regulation in human liver slices treated with the <mark>PPARα</mark> agonist Wy14643.
RESULTS: Quantitative PCR indicated that <mark>PPARα</mark> is well expressed in human liver and human liver slices and that the classical <mark>PPARα</mark> targets <mark>PLIN2</mark>, <mark>VLDLR</mark>, <mark>ANGPTL4</mark>, <mark>CPT1A</mark> and <mark>PDK4</mark> are robustly induced by <mark>PPARα</mark> activation.
Transcriptomics analysis indicated that 617 genes were upregulated and 665 genes were downregulated by <mark>PPARα</mark> activation (q value < 0.05).
Many genes induced by <mark>PPARα</mark> activation were involved in lipid metabolism (<mark>ACSL5</mark>, <mark>AGPAT9</mark>, <mark>FADS1</mark>, <mark>SLC27A4</mark>), xenobiotic metabolism (<mark>POR</mark>, <mark>ABCC2</mark>, <mark>CYP3A5</mark>) or the unfolded protein response, whereas most of the downregulated genes were involved in immune-related pathways.
Among the most highly repressed genes upon <mark>PPARα</mark> activation were several chemokines (e.g. <mark>CXCL9-11</mark>, <mark>CCL8</mark>, <mark>CX3CL1</mark>, <mark>CXCL6</mark>), <mark>interferon γ</mark>-induced genes (e.g. <mark>IFITM1</mark>, <mark>IFIT1</mark>, <mark>IFIT2</mark>, <mark>IFIT3</mark>) and numerous other immune-related genes (e.g. <mark>TLR3</mark>, <mark>NOS2</mark>, and <mark>LCN2</mark>).
Comparative analysis of gene regulation by Wy14643 between human liver slices and primary human hepatocytes showed that down-regulation of gene expression by <mark>PPARα</mark> is much better captured by liver slices as compared to primary hepatocytes.
In particular, <mark>PPARα</mark> activation markedly suppressed immunity/inflammation-related genes in human liver slices but not in primary hepatocytes.
Finally, several putative new target genes of <mark>PPARα</mark> were identified that were commonly induced by <mark>PPARα</mark> activation in the two human liver model systems, including <mark>TSKU</mark>, <mark>RHOF</mark>, <mark>CA12</mark> and <mark>VSIG10L</mark>.
CONCLUSION: Our paper demonstrates the suitability and superiority of human liver slices over primary hepatocytes for studying the functional role of <mark>PPARα</mark> in human liver.
Our data underscore the major role of <mark>PPARα</mark> in regulation of hepatic lipid and xenobiotic metabolism in human liver and reveal a marked immuno-suppressive/anti-inflammatory effect of <mark>PPARα</mark> in human liver slices that may be therapeutically relevant for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
Conditional knockdown of <mark>BCL2A1</mark> reveals rate-limiting roles in <mark>BCR</mark>-dependent B-cell survival.
<mark>Bcl2 family proteins</mark> control mitochondrial apoptosis and its members exert critical cell type and differentiation stage-specific functions, acting as barriers against autoimmunity or transformation.
Anti-apoptotic <mark>Bcl2a1</mark>/<mark>Bfl1</mark>/<mark>A1</mark> is frequently deregulated in different types of blood cancers in humans but its physiological role is poorly understood as quadruplication of the <mark>Bcl2a1</mark> gene locus in mice hampers conventional gene targeting strategies.
Transgenic overexpression of <mark>A1</mark>, deletion of the <mark>A1</mark>-a paralogue or constitutive knockdown in the hematopoietic compartment of mice by RNAi suggested rate-limiting roles in lymphocyte development, granulopoiesis and mast cell activation.
Here we report on the consequences of conditional knockdown of <mark>A1</mark> protein expression using a reverse transactivator (rtTA)-driven approach that highlights a critical role for this <mark>Bcl2 family</mark> member in the maintenance of mature B-cell homeostasis.
Furthermore, we define the <mark>A1</mark>/<mark>Bim</mark> (<mark>Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death</mark>) axis as a target of key kinases mediating <mark>B-cell receptor</mark> (<mark>BCR</mark>)-dependent survival signals, such as, <mark>spleen tyrosine kinase</mark> (<mark>Syk</mark>) and <mark>Brutons tyrosine kinase</mark> (<mark>Btk</mark>).
As such, <mark>A1</mark> represents a putative target for the treatment of B-cell-related pathologies depending on hyperactivation of BCR-emanating survival signals and loss of <mark>A1</mark> expression accounts, in part, for the pro-apoptotic effects of <mark>Syk</mark>- or <mark>Btk</mark> inhibitors that rely on the 'BH3-only' protein <mark>Bim</mark> for cell killing.
<mark>UBASH3B</mark>/<mark>Sts-1</mark>-<mark>CBL</mark> axis regulates myeloid proliferation in human preleukemia induced by <mark>AML1</mark>-<mark>ETO</mark>.
The t(8;21) rearrangement, which creates the <mark>AML1</mark>-<mark>ETO</mark> fusion protein, represents the most common chromosomal translocation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Clinical data suggest that <mark>CBL</mark> mutations are a frequent event in t(8;21) AML, but the role of <mark>CBL</mark> in <mark>AML1</mark>-<mark>ETO</mark>-induced leukemia has not been investigated.
In this study, we demonstrate that <mark>CBL</mark> mutations collaborate with <mark>AML1</mark>-<mark>ETO</mark> to expand human <mark>CD34</mark>+ cells both in vitro and in a xenograft model.
<mark>CBL</mark> depletion by shRNA also promotes the growth of <mark>AML1</mark>-<mark>ETO</mark> cells, demonstrating the inhibitory function of endogenous <mark>CBL</mark> in t(8;21) AML.
Mechanistically, loss of <mark>CBL</mark> function confers hyper-responsiveness to <mark>thrombopoietin</mark> and enhances <mark>STAT5</mark>/<mark>AKT</mark>/<mark>ERK</mark>/<mark>Src</mark> signaling in <mark>AML1</mark>-<mark>ETO</mark> cells.
Interestingly, we found the <mark>protein tyrosine phosphatase</mark> <mark>UBASH3B</mark>/<mark>Sts-1</mark>, which is known to inhibit <mark>CBL</mark> function, is upregulated by <mark>AML1</mark>-<mark>ETO</mark> through transcriptional and <mark>miR-9</mark>-mediated regulation.
<mark>UBASH3B</mark>/<mark>Sts-1</mark> depletion induces an aberrant pattern of <mark>CBL</mark> phosphorylation and impairs proliferation in <mark>AML1</mark>-<mark>ETO</mark> cells.
The growth inhibition caused by <mark>UBASH3B</mark>/<mark>Sts-1</mark> depletion can be rescued by ectopic expression of <mark>CBL</mark> mutants, suggesting that <mark>UBASH3B</mark>/<mark>Sts-1</mark> supports the growth of <mark>AML1</mark>-<mark>ETO</mark> cells partly through modulation of <mark>CBL</mark> function.
Our study reveals a role of <mark>CBL</mark> in restricting myeloid proliferation of human <mark>AML1</mark>-<mark>ETO</mark>-induced leukemia, and identifies <mark>UBASH3B</mark>/<mark>Sts-1</mark> as a potential target for pharmaceutical intervention.
Diagnostic Exome Sequencing Identifies a Novel Gene, <mark>EMILIN1</mark>, Associated with Autosomal-Dominant Hereditary Connective Tissue Disease.
Heritable connective tissue diseases are a highly heterogeneous family of over 200 disorders that affect the extracellular matrix.
While the genetic basis of several disorders is established, the etiology has not been discovered for a large portion of patients, likely due to rare yet undiscovered disease genes.
By performing trio-exome sequencing of a 55-year-old male proband presenting with multiple symptoms indicative of a connective disorder, we identified a heterozygous missense alteration in exon 1 of the <mark>Elastin Microfibril Interfacer 1</mark> (<mark>EMILIN1</mark>) gene, c.64G>A (p.A22T).
The proband presented with ascending and descending aortic aneurysms, bilateral lower leg and foot sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, arthropathy, and increased skin elasticity.
Sanger sequencing confirmed that the <mark>EMILIN1</mark> alteration, which maps around the signal peptide cleavage site, segregated with disease in the affected proband, mother, and <mark>son</mark>.
The impaired secretion of <mark>EMILIN-1</mark> in cells transfected with the mutant p.A22T coincided with abnormal protein accumulation within the endoplasmic reticulum.
In skin biopsy of the proband, we detected less <mark>EMILIN-1</mark> with disorganized and abnormal coarse fibrils, aggregated deposits underneath the epidermis basal lamina, and dermal cells apoptosis.
These findings collectively suggest that <mark>EMILIN1</mark> may represent a new disease gene associated with an autosomal-dominant connective tissue disorder.
<mark>Thymosin beta 4</mark> up-regulates <mark>miR-200a</mark> expression and induces differentiation and survival of rat brain progenitor cells.
<mark>Thymosin beta 4</mark> (<mark>Tbeta4</mark>), a secreted 43 amino acid peptide, promotes oligodendrogenesis, and improves neurological outcome in rat models of neurologic injury.
We demonstrated that exogenous <mark>Tbeta4</mark> treatment up-regulated the expression of the <mark>miR-200a</mark> in vitro in rat brain progenitor cells and in vivo in the peri-infarct area of rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
The up-regulation of <mark>miR-200a</mark> down-regulated the expression of the following targets in vitro and in vivo models: (i) <mark>growth factor receptor-bound protein 2</mark> (<mark>Grb2</mark>), an adaptor protein involved in <mark>epidermal growth factor receptor</mark> (<mark>EGFR</mark>)/<mark>Grb2</mark>/<mark>Ras</mark>/<mark>MEK</mark>/<mark>ERK1</mark>/<mark>c-Jun</mark> signaling pathway, which negatively regulates the expression of <mark>myelin basic protein</mark> (<mark>MBP</mark>), a marker of mature oligodendrocyte; (ii) <mark>ERRFI-1</mark>/<mark>Mig-6</mark>, an endogenous potent <mark>kinase</mark> inhibitor of <mark>EGFR</mark>, which resulted in activation/phosphorylation of <mark>EGFR</mark>; (iii) <mark>friend of GATA 2</mark>, and <mark>phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10</mark> (<mark>PTEN</mark>), which are potent inhibitors of the <mark>phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase</mark> (<mark>PI3K</mark>)/<mark>AKT</mark> signaling pathway, and resulted in marked activation of <mark>AKT</mark>; and (iv) transcription factor, <mark>p53</mark>, which induces pro-apoptotic genes, and possibly reduced apoptosis of the progenitor cells subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD).
Anti-<mark>miR-200a</mark> transfection reversed all the effects of <mark>Tbeta4</mark> treatment in vitro.
Thus, <mark>Tbeta4</mark> up-regulated <mark>MBP</mark> synthesis, and inhibited OGD-induced apoptosis in a novel <mark>miR-200a</mark> dependent <mark>EGFR</mark> signaling pathway.
Our findings of <mark>miR-200a</mark>-mediated protection of progenitor cells may provide a new therapeutic importance for the treatment of neurologic injury.
<mark>Tbeta4</mark>-induced <mark>micro-RNA-200a</mark> (<mark>miR-200a</mark>) regulates <mark>EGFR</mark> signaling pathways for <mark>MBP</mark> synthesis and apoptosis: up-regulation of <mark>miR-200a</mark> after <mark>Tbeta4</mark> treatment, increases <mark>MBP</mark> synthesis after targeting <mark>Grb2</mark> and thereby inactivating <mark>c-Jun</mark> from inhibition of <mark>MBP</mark> synthesis; and also inhibits OGD-mediated apoptosis after targeting <mark>EGFR</mark> inhibitor (<mark>Mig-6</mark>), <mark>PI3K</mark> inhibitors (<mark>FOG2</mark> and <mark>Pten</mark>) and an inducer (<mark>p53</mark>) of pro-apoptotic genes, for <mark>AKT</mark> activation and down-regulation of <mark>p53</mark>.
These findings may contribute the therapeutic benefits for stroke and other neuronal diseases associated with demyelination disorders.
<mark>Dopamine D2-Receptor</mark> Antagonists Down-Regulate <mark>CYP1A1/2</mark> and <mark>CYP1B1</mark> in the Rat Liver.
Dopaminergic systems regulate the release of several hormones including <mark>growth hormone</mark> (<mark>GH</mark>), thyroid hormones, <mark>insulin</mark>, glucocorticoids and <mark>prolactin</mark> (<mark>PRL</mark>) that play significant roles in the regulation of various <mark>Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes</mark>.
The present study investigated the role of <mark>dopamine D2-receptor</mark>-linked pathways in the regulation of <mark>CYP1A1</mark>, <mark>CYP1A2</mark> and <mark>CYP1B1</mark> that belong to a battery of genes controlled by the <mark>Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor</mark> (<mark>AhR</mark>) and play a crucial role in the metabolism and toxicity of numerous environmental toxicants.
Inhibition of <mark>dopamine D2-receptors</mark> with sulpiride (SULP) significantly repressed the constitutive and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P)-induced <mark>CYP1A1</mark>, <mark>CYP1A2</mark> and <mark>CYP1B</mark> expression in the rat liver.
The expression of <mark>AhR</mark>, <mark>heat shock protein 90</mark> (<mark>HSP90</mark>) and <mark>AhR nuclear translocator</mark> (<mark>ARNT</mark>) was suppressed by SULP in B[a]P-treated livers, whereas the <mark>AhRR</mark> expression was increased by the drug suggesting that the SULP-mediated repression of the <mark>CYP1</mark> inducibility is due to inactivation of the <mark>AhR</mark> regulatory system.
At signal transduction level, the <mark>D2</mark>-mediated down-regulation of constitutive <mark>CYP1A1/2</mark> and <mark>CYP1B1</mark> expression appears to be mediated by activation of the <mark>insulin</mark>/<mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>AKT</mark> pathway.
<mark>PRL</mark>-linked pathways exerting a negative control on various <mark>CYPs</mark>, and inactivation of the glucocorticoid-linked pathways that positively control the <mark>AhR</mark>-regulated <mark>CYP1</mark> genes, may also participate in the SULP-mediated repression of both, the constitutive and induced <mark>CYP1</mark> expression.
The present findings indicate that drugs acting as <mark>D2-dopamine receptor</mark> antagonists can modify several hormone systems that regulate the expression of <mark>CYP1A1</mark>, <mark>CYP1A2</mark> and <mark>CYP1B1</mark>, and may affect the toxicity and carcinogenicity outcome of numerous toxicants and pre-carcinogenic substances.
Therefore, these drugs could be considered as a part of the strategy to reduce the risk of exposure to environmental pollutants and pre-carcinogens.
Apoptosis of Sertoli cells after conditional ablation of <mark>murine double minute 2</mark> (<mark>Mdm2</mark>) gene is <mark>p53</mark>-dependent and results in male sterility.
Beside its well-documented role in carcinogenesis, the function of <mark>p53</mark> family has been more recently revealed in development and female reproduction, but it is still poorly documented in male reproduction.
We specifically tested this possibility by ablating <mark>Mdm2</mark>, an <mark>E3 ligase</mark> that regulates <mark>p53</mark> protein stability and transactivation function, specifically in Sertoli cells (SCs) using the AMH-Cre line and created the new SC-<mark>Mdm2</mark>(-/-) line.
Heterozygous SC-<mark>Mdm2</mark>(-/+) adult males were fertile, but SC-<mark>Mdm2</mark>(-/-) males were infertile and exhibited: a shorter ano-genital distance, an extra duct along the vas deferens that presents a uterus-like morphology, degenerated testes with no organized seminiferous tubules and a complete loss of differentiated germ cells.
In adults, testosterone levels as well as <mark>StAR</mark>, <mark>P450c17</mark> (<mark>Cyp17a1</mark>) and <mark>P450scc</mark> (<mark>Cyp11a1</mark>) mRNA levels decreased significantly, and both plasma <mark>LH</mark> and <mark>FSH</mark> levels increased.
A detailed investigation of testicular development indicated that the phenotype arose during fetal life, with SC-<mark>Mdm2</mark>(-/-) testes being much smaller at birth.
Interestingly, Leydig cells remained present until adulthood and fetal germ cells abnormally initiated meiosis.
Inactivation of <mark>Mdm2</mark> in SCs triggered <mark>p53</mark> activation and apoptosis as early as 15.5 days post conception with significant increase in apoptotic SCs.
Importantly, testis development occurred normally in SC-<mark>Mdm2</mark>(-/-) lacking <mark>p53</mark> mice (SC-<mark>Mdm2</mark>(-/-)<mark>p53</mark>(-/-)) and accordingly, these mice were fertile indicating that the aforementioned phenotypes are entirely <mark>p53</mark>-dependent.
These data not only highlight the importance of keeping <mark>p53</mark> in check for proper testicular development and male fertility but also certify the critical role of SCs in the maintenance of meiotic repression.
<mark>Wnt</mark> signaling in age-related macular degeneration: human macular tissue and mouse model.
BACKGROUND: The wingless-type MMTV integration site (<mark>Wnt</mark>) signaling is a group of signal transduction pathways.
In canonical <mark>Wnt</mark> pathway, <mark>Wnt</mark> ligands bind to <mark>low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 or 6</mark> (<mark>LRP5</mark> or <mark>LRP6</mark>), resulting in phosphorylation and activation of the receptor.
We hypothesize that canonical <mark>Wnt</mark> pathway plays a role in the retinal lesion of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of irreversible central visual loss in elderly.
METHODS: We examined <mark>LRP6</mark> phosphorylation and <mark>Wnt</mark> signaling cascade in human retinal sections and plasma <mark>kallistatin</mark>, an endogenous inhibitor of the <mark>Wnt</mark> pathway in AMD patients and non-AMD subjects.
We also used the <mark>Ccl2</mark> (-/-) /<mark>Cx3cr1</mark> (-/-) /rd8 and <mark>Ccl2</mark> (-/-) /<mark>Cx3cr1</mark> (gfp/gfp) mouse models with AMD-like retinal degeneration to further explore the involvement of <mark>Wnt</mark> signaling activation in the retinal lesions in those models and to preclinically evaluate the role of <mark>Wnt</mark> signaling suppression as a potential therapeutic option for AMD.
RESULTS: We found higher levels of <mark>LRP6</mark> (a key <mark>Wnt</mark> signaling receptor) protein phosphorylation and transcripts of the <mark>Wnt</mark> pathway-targeted genes, as well as higher <mark>beta-catenin</mark> protein in AMD macula compared to controls.
<mark>Kallistatin</mark> was decreased in the plasma of AMD patients.
Retinal non-phosphorylated-<mark>β-catenin</mark> and phosphorylated-<mark>LRP6</mark> were higher in <mark>Ccl2</mark> (-/-) /<mark>Cx3cr1</mark> (-/-) /rd8 mice than that in wild type.
Intravitreal administration of an anti-<mark>LRP6</mark> antibody slowed the progression of retinal lesions in <mark>Ccl2</mark> (-/-) /<mark>Cx3cr1</mark> (-/-) /rd8 and <mark>Ccl2</mark> (-/-) /<mark>Cx3cr1</mark> (gfp/gfp) mice.
Electroretinography of treated eyes exhibited larger amplitudes compared to controls in both mouse models.
A2E, a retinoid byproduct associated with AMD was lower in the treated eyes of <mark>Ccl2</mark> (-/-) /<mark>Cx3cr1</mark> (-/-) /rd8 mice.
Anti-<mark>LRP6</mark> also suppressed the expression of <mark>Tnf-α</mark> and <mark>Icam-1</mark> in <mark>Ccl2</mark> (-/-) /<mark>Cx3cr1</mark> (-/-) /rd8 retinas.
CONCLUSIONS: <mark>Wnt</mark> signaling may be disturbed in AMD patients, which could contribute to the retinal inflammation and increased A2E levels found in AMD.
Aberrant activation of canonical <mark>Wnt</mark> signaling might also contribute to the focal retinal degenerative lesions of mouse models with <mark>Ccl2</mark> and <mark>Cx3cr1</mark> deficiency, and intravitreal administration of anti-<mark>LRP6</mark> antibody could be beneficial by deactivating the canonical <mark>Wnt</mark> pathway.
<mark>HMGB1</mark> promotes HCC progression partly by downregulating <mark>p21</mark> via <mark>ERK</mark>/<mark>c-Myc</mark> pathway and upregulating <mark>MMP-2</mark>.
<mark>High-mobility group box 1</mark> (<mark>HMGB1</mark>) was found to be over-expressed in many kinds of human cancer, which binds with several receptors and activates <mark>RAGE</mark>-<mark>Ras</mark>-<mark>MAPK</mark>, <mark>Toll-like receptors</mark>, <mark>NF-κB</mark>, and <mark>Src family kinase</mark> signaling pathways and plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression.
However, the function and mechanism of <mark>HMGB1</mark> in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of <mark>HMGB1</mark> on HCC progression and explore new molecular mechanism.
<mark>HMGB1</mark> transient knockdown, stable knockdown, and re-expression were performed by transfection with specific siRNA, shRNA, or expression vector in HCCLM3 cells.
Results showed that transient knockdown <mark>HMGB1</mark> prevented cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, induced S phase arrest, and inhibited migration and invasion in vitro, and stable knockdown <mark>HMGB1</mark> inhibited xenograft growth in Balb/c athymic mice in vivo.
Molecular mechanism investigation revealed that knockdown <mark>HMGB1</mark> significantly reduced the activation of <mark>MAPKs</mark>, including <mark>ERK1/2</mark>, <mark>p38</mark>, <mark>SAPK</m<mark>SAPK/JNK</ma<mark>JNK</mark>, as well as <mark>MAPKKs</mark> (<mark>MEK1/2</mark>, <mark>SEK1</mark>) and its substrates (<mark>c-Jun</mark>, <mark>c-Myc</<mark>c-Myc)</mark>; downregulated <mark>NF-κB/p<mark>NF-κB</mark>a<mark>p65</mark> expression and phosphorylation level; decreased <mark>MMP-2</mark> expression and activity; and upregulated <mark>p21</mark> expression.
Interestingly, <mark>c-Myc</mark> was firstly found to be involved in the promoting function of <mark>HMGB1</mark> on HCC progression, which provided a novel clue for the inhibitory effect of <mark>HMGB1</mark> on <mark>p21</mark> expression by a <mark>p53</mark>-independent pathway.
Collectively, these findings indicated that <mark>HMGB1</mark> promoted HCC progression partly by enhancing the <mark>ERK1/2</mark> and <mark>NF-κB</mark> pathways, upregulating <mark>MMP-2</mark>, and downregulating <mark>p21</mark> via an <mark>ERK</mark>/<mark>c-Myc</mark> pathway.
Changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression during pancreatic cancer development and progression in a genetically engineered <mark>Kras</mark>G12D;<mark>Pdx1</mark>-<mark>Cre</mark> mouse (KC) model.
Differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been demonstrated in various cancers, including pancreatic cancer (PC).
Due to the lack of tissue samples from early-stages of PC, the stage-specific alteration of miRNAs during PC initiation and progression is largely unknown.
In this study, we investigated the global miRNA expression profile and their processing machinery during PC progression using the <mark>Kras</mark>G12D;<mark>Pdx1</mark>-<mark>Cre</mark> (KC) mouse model.
At 25 weeks, the miRNA microarray analysis revealed significant downregulation of <mark>miR-150</mark>, <mark>miR-494</mark>, <mark>miR-138</mark>, <mark>miR-148a</mark>, <mark>miR-216a</mark>, and <mark>miR-217</mark> and upregulation of <mark>miR-146b</mark>, <mark>miR-205</mark>, <mark>miR-31</mark>, <mark>miR-192</mark>, and <mark>miR-21</mark> in KC mice compared to controls.
Further, expression of miRNA biosynthetic machinery including <mark>Dicer</mark>, <mark>Exportin-5</mark>, <mark>TRKRA</mark>, and <mark>TARBP2</mark> were downregulated, while <mark>DGCR8</mark> and <mark>Ago2</mark> were upregulated in KC mice.
In addition, from 10 to 50 weeks of age, stage-specific expression profiling of miRNA in KC mice revealed downregulation of <mark>miR-216</mark>, <mark>miR-217</mark>, <mark>miR-100</mark>, <mark>miR-345</mark>, <mark>miR-141</mark>, <mark>miR-483-3p</mark>, <mark>miR-26b</mark>, <mark>miR-150</mark>, <mark>miR-195</mark>, <mark>Let-7b</mark> and <mark>Let-96</mark> and upregulation of <mark>miR-21</mark>, <mark>miR-205</mark>, <mark>miR-146b</mark>, <mark>miR-34c</mark>, <mark>miR-1273</mark>, <mark>miR-223</mark> and <mark>miR-195</mark> compared to control mice.
Interestingly, the differential expression of miRNA in mice also corroborated with the miRNA expression in human PC cell lines and tissue samples; ectopic expression of <mark>Let-7b</mark> in <mark>CD18</mark>/HPAF and Capan1 cells resulted in the downregulation of <mark>KRAS</mark> and <mark>MSST1</mark> expression.
Overall, the present study aids an understanding of miRNA expression patterns during PC pathogenesis and helps to facilitate the identification of promising and novel early diagnostic/prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.
Identification of <mark>Evening Complex</mark> Associated Proteins in Arabidopsis by Affinity Purification and Mass Spectrometry.
Many species possess an endogenous circadian clock to synchronize internal physiology with an oscillating external environment.
In plants, the circadian clock coordinates growth, metabolism and development over daily and seasonal time scales.
Many proteins in the circadian network form oscillating complexes that temporally regulate myriad processes, including signal transduction, transcription, protein degradation and post-translational modification.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, a tripartite complex composed of <mark>EARLY FLOWERING 4</mark> (<mark>ELF4</mark>), <mark>EARLY FLOWERING 3</mark> (<mark>ELF3</mark>), and <mark>LUX ARRHYTHMO</mark> (<mark>LUX</mark>), named the <mark>evening complex</mark>, modulates daily rhythms in gene expression and growth through transcriptional regulation.
However, little is known about the physical interactions that connect the circadian system to other pathways.
We used affinity purification and mass spectrometry (AP-MS) methods to identify proteins that associate with the <mark>evening complex</mark> in A. thaliana.
New connections within the circadian network as well as to light signaling pathways were identified, including linkages between the <mark>evening complex</mark>, <mark>TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1</mark> (<mark>TOC1</mark>), <mark>TIME FOR COFFEE</mark> (<mark>TIC</mark>), all <mark>phytochromes</mark> and <mark>TANDEM ZINC KNUCKLE/PLUS3</mark> (<mark>TZP</mark>).
Coupling genetic mutation with affinity purifications tested the roles of <mark>phytochrome B</mark> (<mark>phyB</mark>), <mark>EARLY FLOWERING 4</mark>, and <mark>EARLY FLOWERING 3</mark> as nodes connecting the <mark>evening complex</mark> to clock and light signaling pathways.
These experiments establish a hierarchical association between pathways and indicate direct and indirect interactions.
Specifically, the results suggested that <mark>EARLY FLOWERING 3</mark> and <mark>phytochrome B</mark> act as hubs connecting the clock and red light signaling pathways.
Finally, we characterized a clade of associated nuclear <mark>kinases</mark> that regulate circadian rhythms, growth, and flowering in A. thaliana.
Coupling mass spectrometry and genetics is a powerful method to rapidly and directly identify novel components and connections within and between complex signaling pathways.
<mark>ALS5</mark>/<mark>SPG11</mark>/<mark>KIAA1840</mark> mutations cause autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a group of hereditary peripheral neuropathies that share clinical characteristics of progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy, foot deformities, distal sensory loss, as well as diminished tendon reflexes.
Hundreds of causative DNA changes have been found, but much of the genetic basis of the disease is still unexplained.
Mutations in the <mark>ALS5</mark>/<mark>SPG11</mark>/<mark>KIAA1840</mark> gene are a frequent cause of autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum and peripheral axonal neuropathy, and account for ~ 40% of autosomal recessive juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
The overlap of axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with both diseases, as well as the common autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of thin corpus callosum and axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in three related patients, prompted us to analyse the <mark>ALS5</mark>/<mark>SPG11</mark>/<mark>KIAA1840</mark> gene in affected individuals with autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
We investigated 28 unrelated families with autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease defined by clinical, electrophysiological, as well as pathological evaluation.
Besides, we screened for all the known genes related to axonal autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (<mark>CMT2A2</mark>/<mark>HMSN2A2</mark>/<mark>MFN2</mark>, <mark>CMT2B1</mark>/<mark>LMNA</mark>, <mark>CMT2B2</mark>/<mark>MED25</mark>, <mark>CMT2B5</mark>/<mark>NEFL</mark>, <mark>ARCMT2F</mark>/d<mark>HMN2B</mark>/<mark>HSPB1</mark>, <mark>CMT2K</mark>/<mark>GDAP1</mark>, <mark>CMT2P</mark>/<mark>LRSAM1</mark>, <mark>CMT2R</mark>/<mark>TRIM2</mark>, <mark>CMT2S</mark>/<mark>IGHMBP2</mark>, <mark>CMT2T</mark>/<mark>HSJ1</mark>, <mark>CMTRID</mark>/<mark>COX6A1</mark>, <mark>ARAN-NM</mark>/<mark>HINT</mark> and <mark>GAN</mark>/<mark>GAN</mark>), for the genes related to autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum and axonal peripheral neuropathy (<mark>SPG7</mark>/<mark>PGN</mark>, <mark>SPG15</mark>/<mark>ZFYVE26</mark>, <mark>SPG21</mark>/<mark>ACP33</mark>, <mark>SPG35</mark>/<mark>FA2H</mark>, <mark>SPG46</mark>/<mark>GBA2</mark>, <mark>SPG55</mark>/<mark>C12orf65</mark> and <mark>SPG56</mark>/<mark>CYP2U1</mark>), as well as for the causative gene of peripheral neuropathy with or without agenesis of the corpus callosum (<mark>SLC12A6</mark>).
Mitochondrial disorders related to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 were also excluded by sequencing <mark>POLG</mark> and <mark>TYMP</mark> genes.
An additional locus for autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2H on chromosome 8q13-21.1 was excluded by linkage analysis.
Pedigrees originated in Italy, Brazil, Canada, England, Iran, and Japan.
Interestingly, we identified 15 <mark>ALS5</mark>/<mark>SPG11</mark>/<mark>KIAA1840</mark> mutations in 12 families (two sequence variants were never reported before, p.Gln198* and p.Pro2212fs*5).
No large deletions/duplications were detected in these patients.
The novel mutations seemed to be pathogenic since they co-segregated with the disease in all pedigrees and were absent in 300 unrelated controls.
Furthermore, in silico analysis predicted their pathogenic effect.
Our results indicate that <mark>ALS5</mark>/<mark>SPG11</mark>/<mark>KIAA1840</mark> is the causative gene of a wide spectrum of clinical features, including autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
Synovial Regulatory T Cells Occupy a Discrete <mark>TCR</mark> Niche in Human Arthritis and Require Local Signals To Stabilize <mark>FOXP3</mark> Protein Expression.
Although there is great interest in harnessing the immunosuppressive potential of <mark>FOXP3</mark>(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) for treating autoimmunity, a sizeable knowledge gap exists regarding Treg fate in human disease.
In juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients, we have previously reported that atypical <mark>CD25</mark>(+)<mark>FOXP3</mark>(-) Treg-like cells uniquely populate the inflamed site.
Intriguingly, their proportions relative to <mark>CD25</mark>(+)<mark>FOXP3</mark>(+) Tregs associate with arthritis course, suggesting a role in disease.
The ontogeny of these <mark>FOXP3</mark>(-) Treg-like cells is, however, unknown.
In this study, we interrogated clonal relationships between <mark>CD4</mark>(+) T cell subsets in JIA, using high-throughput <mark>TCR</mark> repertoire analysis.
We reveal that <mark>FOXP3</mark>(+) Tregs possess highly exclusive <mark>TCRβ</mark> usage from conventional T cells, in blood, and also at the inflamed site, where they are clonally expanded.
Intriguingly, the repertoires of <mark>FOXP3</mark>(+) Tregs in synovial fluid are highly overlapping with <mark>CD25</mark>(+)<mark>FOXP3</mark>(-) Treg-like cells, indicating fluctuations in <mark>FOXP3</mark> expression in the inflamed joint.
Furthermore, cultured synovial Tregs rapidly downregulated <mark>FOXP3</mark> protein (but not mRNA), and this process was prevented by addition of synovial fluid from JIA patients, through an <mark>IL-6</mark>-independent mechanism.
Our findings suggest that most Tregs arise from a separate lineage from conventional T cells, and that this repertoire divergence is largely maintained under chronic inflammatory conditions.
We propose that subsequent Treg expansions at the inflamed site creates an environment that leads to competition for limited resources within the synovium, resulting in the destabilization of <mark>FOXP3</mark> expression in some Tregs.
Dendritic Cell-Specific Deletion of <mark>beta-Catenin</mark> Results in Fewer Regulatory T-Cells without Exacerbating Autoimmune <mark>Collagen</mark>-Induced Arthritis.
Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells that have the dual ability to stimulate immunity and maintain tolerance.
However, the signalling pathways mediating tolerogenic DC function in vivo remain largely unknown.
The <mark>beta-catenin</mark> pathway has been suggested to promote a regulatory DC phenotype.
The aim of this study was to unravel the role of <mark>beta-catenin</mark> signalling to control DC function in the autoimmune <mark>collagen</mark>-induced arthritis model (CIA).
Deletion of <mark>beta-catenin</mark> specifically in DCs was achieved by crossing conditional knockout mice with a <mark>CD11c</mark>-Cre transgenic mouse line.
Bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) were generated and used to study the maturation profile of these cells in response to a <mark>TLR2</mark> or <mark>TLR4</mark> ligand stimulation.
CIA was induced by intra-dermal immunization with 100 mug chicken <mark>type II collagen</mark> in complete Freund's adjuvant on days 0 and 21.
CIA incidence and severity was monitored macroscopically and by histology.
The T cell profile as well as their <mark>cytokine</mark> production were analysed by flow cytometry.
Lack of <mark>beta-catenin</mark> specifically in DCs did not affect the spontaneous, <mark>TLR2</mark>- or <mark>TLR4</mark>-induced maturation and activation of BMDCs or their <mark>cytokine</mark> production.
Moreover, no effect on the incidence and severity of CIA was observed in mice lacking <mark>beta-catenin</mark> in <mark>CD11c</mark>+ cells.
A decreased frequency of splenic <mark>CD3</mark>+<mark>CD8</mark>+ T cells and of regulatory T cells (Tregs) (<mark>CD4</mark>+<mark>CD25</mark>high<mark>FoxP3</mark>+), but no changes in the frequency of splenic Th17 (<mark>CCR6</mark>+<mark>CXCR3</mark>-<mark>CCR4</mark>+), Th2 (<mark>CCR6</mark>-<mark>CXCR3</mark>-<mark>CCR4</mark>+) and Th1 (<mark>CCR6</mark>-<mark>CXCR3</mark>+<mark>CCR4</mark>-) cells were observed in these mice under CIA condition.
Furthermore, the expression of <mark>IL-17A</mark>, <mark>IL-17F</mark>, <mark>IL-22</mark>, <mark>IL-4</mark> or <mark>IFNgamma</mark> was also not affected.
Our data indicate that ablation of <mark>beta-catenin</mark> expression in DCs did not alter the course and severity of CIA.
We conclude that although deletion of <mark>beta-catenin</mark> resulted in a lower frequency of Tregs, this decrease was not sufficient to aggravate the onset and severity of CIA.
Upregulation of <mark>centrosomal protein 55</mark> is associated with unfavorable prognosis and tumor invasion in epithelial ovarian carcinoma.
<mark>Centrosomal protein 55</mark> (<mark>CEP55</mark>) is a cell cycle regulator implicated in development of certain cancers.
However, characteristics of <mark>CEP55</mark> expression and its clinical/prognostic significance are unclear in human epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC).
Therefore, we investigated the expression and clinicopathological significance of <mark>CEP55</mark> in patients with EOC and its role in regulating invasion and metastasis of ovarian cell lines.
<mark>CEP55</mark> mRNA and protein expression levels were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Potential associations of <mark>CEP55</mark> expression scores with clinical parameters and patient survival were evaluated.
<mark>CEP55</mark> function was investigated further using RNA interference, wound healing assay, transwell assay, immunofluorescence analysis, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting.
<mark>CEP55</mark> was significantly upregulated in ovarian cancer cell lines and lesions compared with normal cells and adjacent noncancerous ovarian tissues.
In the 213 EOC samples, <mark>CEP55</mark> protein levels were positively correlated with clinical stage (P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), intraperitoneal metastasis (P < 0.001), tumor recurrence (P < 0.001), differentiation grade (P < 0.001), residual tumor size (P < 0.001), ascites see tumor cells (P = 0.020), and serum <mark>CA153</mark> level (P < 0.001).
Moreover, patients with aberrant <mark>CEP55</mark> protein expression showed tendencies to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P < 0.001) and cytoreductive surgery (P = 0.020).
By contrast, no significant correlation was detected between the protein levels and patient age, histological type, or serum <mark>CA125</mark>, <mark>CA199</mark>, <mark>CA724</mark>, <mark>NSE</mark>, <mark>CEA</mark>, and <mark>β-HCG</mark> levels.
Patients with high <mark>CEP55</mark> protein expression had shorter overall survival and disease-free survival compared with those with low <mark>CEP55</mark> expression.
Multivariate analysis implicated <mark>CEP55</mark> as an independent prognostic indicator for EOC patients.
Additionally, downregulation of <mark>CEP55</mark> in ovarian cancer cells remarkably inhibited cellular motility and invasion.
Aberrant <mark>CEP55</mark> expression may predict unfavorable clinical outcomes in EOC patients and play an important role in regulating invasion in ovarian cancer cells.
Thus, <mark>CEP55</mark> may serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for EOC.
Role of <mark>MCP-1</mark> on inflammatory processes and metabolic dysfunction following high-fat feedings in the FVB/N strain.
BACKGROUND: <mark>Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1</mark> (<mark>MCP-1</mark>) is known to be an important <mark>chemokine</mark> for macrophage recruitment.
Thus, targeting <mark>MCP-1</mark> may prevent the perturbations associated with macrophage-induced inflammation in adipose tissue.
However, inconsistencies in the available animal literature have questioned the role of this <mark>chemokine</mark> in this process.
The purpose of this study was to examine the role of <mark>MCP-1</mark> on obesity-related pathologies.
METHODS: Wild-type and <mark>MCP-1</mark>-deficient mice on an friend virus B NIH (FVB/N) background were assigned to either low-fat diet or high-fat diet (HFD) treatment for a period of 16 weeks.
Body weight and body composition were measured weekly and monthly, respectively.
Fasting blood glucose and <mark>insulin</mark>, and glucose tolerance were measured at 16 weeks.
Macrophages, T-cell markers, inflammatory mediators and markers of fibrosis were examined in the adipose tissue at the time of killing the mice.
RESULTS: As expected, HFD increased adiposity (body weight, fat mass, fat percent and adipocyte size), metabolic dysfunction (impaired glucose metabolism and <mark>insulin</mark> resistance) macrophage number (<mark>CD11b</mark>(+)<mark>F480(</<mark>F480</mark>>+) cells, and gene expression of <mark>EMR1</mark> and <mark>CD11c</mark>), T-cell markers (gene expression of <mark>CD4</mark> and <mark>CD8</mark>), inflammatory mediators (p<mark>NFκB</mark> and p<mark>JNK</mark>, and mRNA expression of <mark>MCP-1</mark>, <mark>CCL5</mark>, <mark>C-X-C motif chemokine-14</mark>, <mark>tumor necrosis factor α</mark> (<mark>TNF-α</mark>) and <mark>interleukin-6</mark> (<mark>IL-6</mark>)) and fibrosis (expression of <mark>IL-10</mark>, <mark>IL-13</mark>, <mark>TGF-β</mark> and <mark>matrix metalloproteinase-2</mark> (<mark>MMP2</mark>); P<0.05).
However, contrary to our hypothesis, <mark>MCP-1</mark> deficiency exacerbated many of these responses resulting in a further increase in adiposity (body weight, fat mass, fat percent and adipocyte size), metabolic dysregulation, macrophage markers (<mark>EMR1</mark>), inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis (formation of <mark>type I and III collagens</mark>, mRNA expression of <mark>IL-10</mark> and <mark>MMP2</mark>; P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that <mark>MCP-1</mark> may be a necessary component of the inflammatory response required for adipose tissue protection, remodeling and healthy expansion in the FVB/N strain in response to HFD feedings.
Search for regulatory factors of the pituitary-specific <mark>transcription factor</mark> <mark>PROP1</mark> gene.
Pituitary-specific <mark>transcription factor</mark> <mark>PROP1</mark>, a factor important for pituitary organogenesis, appears on rat embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) in <mark>SOX2</mark>-expressing stem/progenitor cells and always coexists with <mark>SOX2</mark> throughout life.
<mark>PROP1</mark>-positive cells at one point occupy all cells in Rathke's pouch, followed by a rapid decrease in their number.
Their regulatory factors, except for <mark>RBP-J</mark>, have not yet been clarified.
This study aimed to use the 3 kb upstream region and 1st intron of mouse <mark>prop1</mark> to pinpoint a group of factors selected on the basis of expression in the early pituitary gland for expression of <mark>Prop1</mark>.
Reporter assays for <mark>SOX2</mark> and <mark>RBP-J</mark> showed that the stem/progenitor marker <mark>SOX2</mark> has cell type-dependent inhibitory and activating functions through the proximal and distal upstream regions of <mark>Prop1</mark>, respectively, while <mark>RBP-J</mark> had small regulatory activity in some cell lines.
Reporter assays for another 39 factors using the 3 kb upstream regions in CHO cells ultimately revealed that 8 factors, <mark>MSX2</mark>, <mark>PAX6</mark>, <mark>PIT1</mark>, <mark>PITX1</mark>, <mark>PITX2</mark>, <mark>RPF1</mark>, <mark>SOX8</mark> and <mark>SOX11</mark>, but not <mark>RBP-J</mark>, regulate <mark>Prop1</mark> expression.
Furthermore, a synergy effect with <mark>SOX2</mark> was observed for an additional 10 factors, <mark>FOXJ1</mark>, <mark>HES1</mark>, <mark>HEY1</mark>, <mark>HEY2</mark>, <mark>KLF6</mark>, <mark>MSX1</mark>, <mark>RUNX1</mark>, <mark>TEAD2</mark>, <mark>YBX2</mark> and <mark>ZFP36Ll</mark>, which did not show substantial independent action.
Thus, we demonstrated 19 candidates, including <mark>SOX2</mark>, to be regulatory factors of <mark>Prop1</mark> expression.
Dioscin alleviates alcoholic liver fibrosis by attenuating hepatic stellate cell activation via the <mark>TLR4</mark>/<mark>MyD88</mark>/<mark>NF-κB</mark> signaling pathway.
The present work aimed to investigate the activities and underlying mechanisms of dioscin against alcoholic liver fibrosis (ALF).
In vivo liver fibrosis in mice was induced by an alcoholic liquid diet, and in vitro studies were performed on activated HSC-T6 and LX2 cells treated with lipopolysaccharide.
Our results showed that dioscin significantly attenuated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation, improved <mark>collagen</mark> accumulation, and attenuated inflammation through down-regulating the levels of <mark>myeloid differentiation factor 88</mark> (<mark>MyD88</mark>), <mark>nuclear factor κB</mark> (<mark>NF-κB</mark>), <mark>interleukin (IL)-1</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark> and <mark>tumour necrosis factor-α</mark> by decreasing <mark>Toll-like receptor (TLR)4</mark> expression both in vivo and in vitro.
<mark>TLR4</mark> overexpression was also decreased by dioscin, leading to the markedly down-regulated levels of <mark>MyD88</mark>, <mark>NF-κB</mark>, <mark>transforming growth factor-β1</mark> (<mark>TGF-β1</mark>), <mark>α-smooth muscle actin</mark> (<mark>α-SMA</mark>) and <mark>type I collagen</mark> (<mark>COL1A1</mark>) in cultured HSCs.
Suppression of cellular <mark>MyD88</mark> by ST2825 or abrogation of <mark>NF-κB</mark> by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate eliminated the inhibitory effects of dioscin on the levels of <mark>TGF-β1</mark>, <mark>α-SMA</mark> and <mark>COL1A1</mark>.
In a word, dioscin exhibited potent effects against ALF via altering <mark>TLR4</mark>/<mark>MyD88</mark>/<mark>NF-κB</mark> signaling pathway, which provided novel insights into the mechanisms of this compound as an antifibrogenic candidate for the treatment of ALF in the future.
Identification of the <mark>BRAF</mark> V600E mutation in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
Genomic profiles of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are still insufficiently understood, and the genetic alterations associated with drug responses have not been studied.
Here, we performed whole exome sequencing of 12 GEP-NETs from patients enrolled in a nonrandomized, open-labeled, single-center phase II study for pazopanib, and integrated our results with previously published results on pancreas (n = 12) and small intestine NETs (n = 50).
The mean numbers of somatic mutations in each case varied widely from 20 to 4682.
Among 12 GEP-NETs, eight showed mutations of more than one cancer-related gene, including <mark>TP53</mark>, <mark>CNBD1</mark>, <mark>RB1</mark>, <mark>APC</mark>, <mark>BCOR</mark>, <mark>BRAF</mark>, <mark>CTNNB1</mark>, <mark>EGFR</mark>, <mark>EP300</mark>, <mark>ERBB3</mark>, <mark>KDM6A</mark>, <mark>KRAS</mark>, <mark>MGA</mark>, <mark>MLL3</mark>, <mark>PTEN</mark>, <mark>RASA1</mark>, <mark>SMARCB1</mark>, <mark>SPEN</mark>, <mark>TBC1D12</mark>, and <mark>VHL</mark>.
<mark>TP53</mark> was recurrently mutated in three cases, whereas <mark>CNBD1</mark> and <mark>RB1</mark> mutations were identified in two cases.
Three GEP-NET patients with <mark>TP53</mark> mutations demonstrated a durable response and one small intestinal grade (G) 1 NET patient with <mark>BRAF</mark> V600E mutation showed progression after pazopanib treatment.
We found <mark>BRAF</mark> V600E (G1 NET from rectum and two G3 NETs from colon) and <mark>BRAF</mark> G593S (G2 NET from pancreas) missense mutations (9.1%) in an independent cohort of 44 GEP-NETs from the rectum (n = 26), colon (n = 7), pancreas (n = 4), small intestine (n = 3), stomach (n = 3) and appendix (n = 1) by Sanger sequencing.
All tumor specimens were obtained before chemotherapy.
In conclusion, <mark>BRAF</mark> V600E mutation is likely to result in resistance to pazopanib but may be a potentianally actionable mutation in metastatic GEP-NETs patients.
S. cerevisiae <mark>Mre11</mark> recruits conjugated <mark>SUMO</mark> moieties to facilitate the assembly and function of the <mark>Mre11</mark>-<mark>Rad50</mark>-<mark>Xrs2</mark> complex.
Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in chromosomes are the most challenging type of DNA damage.
The yeast and mammalian <mark>Mre11</mark>-<mark>Rad50</mark>-<mark>Xrs2</mark>/<mark>Nbs1</mark> (<mark>MRX/N</mark>)-<mark>Sae2</mark>/<mark>Ctp1</mark> complex catalyzes the resection of DSBs induced by secondary structures, chemical adducts or covalently-attached proteins.
<mark>MRX/N</mark> also initiates two parallel DNA damage responses-checkpoint phosphorylation and global SUMOylation-to boost a cell's ability to repair DSBs.
However, the molecular mechanism of this <mark>SUMO</mark>-mediated response is not completely known.
In this study, we report that Saccharomyces cerevisiae <mark>Mre11</mark> can non-covalently recruit the conjugated <mark>SUMO</mark> moieties, particularly the poly-<mark>SUMO</mark> chain.
<mark>Mre11</mark> has two evolutionarily-conserved <mark>SUMO</mark>-interacting motifs, <mark>Mre11</mark>(SIM1) and <mark>Mre11</mark>(SIM2), which reside on the outermost surface of <mark>Mre11</mark>.
<mark>Mre11</mark>(SIM1) is indispensable for <mark>MRX</mark> assembly.
<mark>Mre11</mark>(SIM2) non-covalently links <mark>MRX</mark> with the <mark>SUMO enzymes</mark> (<mark>E2/Ubc9</mark> and <mark>E3/Siz2</mark>) to promote global SUMOylation of DNA repair proteins.
<mark>Mre11</mark>(SIM2) acts independently of checkpoint phosphorylation.
During meiosis, the <mark>mre11</mark>(SIM2) mutant, as for <mark>mre11</mark>S, <mark>rad50</mark>S and <mark>sae2</mark>Delta, allows initiation but not processing of <mark>Spo11</mark>-induced DSBs.
Using <mark>MRX</mark> and DSB repair as a model, our work reveals a general principle in which the conjugated <mark>SUMO</mark> moieties non-covalently facilitate the assembly and functions of multi-subunit protein complexes.
Effect of <mark>junctional adhesion molecule-2</mark> expression on cell growth, invasion and migration in human colorectal cancer.
The <mark>junctional adhesion molecule</mark> (<mark>JAM</mark>s) family belongs to the <mark>immunoglobulin</mark> subfamily involved in the formation of tight junctions (TJ) in both endothelial and epithelial cells.
Aberrant expression of <mark>JAM-2</mark> is associated with cancer progression but little work has been carried out in discovering how this affects changes in cell behaviour.
The present study aimed to examine the expression of <mark>JAM-2</mark> in human colon cancer specimens and cell lines and its role in the development of colon cancer.
<mark>JAM-2</mark> expression in human colon cancer specimens (normal, n=75; cancer, n=94) and cell lines was analysed using quantitative real-time PCR and conventional RT-PCR.
Colon cancer cells were stably transfected with a mammalian expression vector to overexpress <mark>JAM-2</mark>-Flag.
The effect on growth, adhesion and migration following overexpression of <mark>JAM-2</mark> was then investigated using in vitro models.
TJ function was assessed using a trans-epithelial resistance assay (TER, with an EVOM voltammeter).
<mark>JAM-2</mark> was lowly expressed in colon cancer cells such as RKO, HT115.
<mark>JAM-2</mark> overexpression in RKO cells (RKO-<mark>JAM-2</mark>) and HT115 cells (HT115-<mark>JAM-2</mark>) showed retarded adhesion (P<0.05).
An in vivo tumour model showed that RKO-<mark>JAM-2</mark> had significantly reduced growth (P<0.05), invasion (P<0.05) and migration (P<0.05) as well as in HT115-<mark>JAM-2</mark>, except on proliferation and migration.
Expression of <mark>JAM-2</mark> resulted in a significant increase in TER and decrease in permeability of polarized monolayers (P<0.05).
Further analysis of <mark>JAM-2</mark> transcript levels against clinical aspects demonstrated that the decreasing <mark>JAM-2</mark> expression correlated to disease progression, metastasis and poor survival.
Taken together, <mark>JAM-2</mark> may function as a putative tumour suppressor in the progression and metastasis of colorectal cancer.
<mark>Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein-3</mark> as a marker for distinguishing between cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and keratoacanthoma.
In the histopathological diagnosis of cutaneous tumors, the differential diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with crateriform architecture and keratoacanthoma (KA) is often difficult so an accurate understanding of the biological features and the identification of reliable markers of SCC and KA are crucial issues.
<mark>Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein-3</mark> (<mark>IGF2BP3</mark>, also known as <mark>IMP3</mark>) is thought of as a bona fide oncofetal protein, which is overexpressed and is involved in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in several kinds of tumors.
However, the role of <mark>IMP3</mark> in cutaneous SCC and KA has not been well studied.
Therefore, we focused on studying the biological functions of <mark>IMP3</mark> in SCC and KA.
In human skin SCC cell lines, HSC-1 and HSC-5, and the human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, <mark>IMP3</mark> mRNA levels were significantly higher than that of normal human skin.
The knockdown of <mark>IMP3</mark> expression reduced the proliferation of HSC-1, and significantly reduced invasion by HSC-1 and HSC-5.
In contrast, the knockdown of <mark>IMP3</mark> did not significantly affect invasion by HaCaT cells.
In immunohistochemical studies of SCC and KA tissues, the <mark>Ki-67</mark> labeling index (LI) of the suprabasal cell layer was significantly higher in SCC, compared with KA tissues and the tumor-free margin (TFM) adjacent to SCC and KA.
Most SCC tissues stained strongly positive for <mark>IMP3</mark>, but KA tissues and TFM were mostly negative for <mark>IMP3</mark>.
The <mark>Ki-67</mark> LI of the <mark>IMP3</mark>-positive group was significantly higher than that of the <mark>IMP3</mark>-negative group in the suprabasal cell layer of SCC.
These results suggest that <mark>IMP3</mark> plays an important role in proliferation and, more significantly, in the invasion of SCC, and may be a suitable marker for the histopathological diagnosis of SCC with a crateriform architecture and KA.
Furthermore, <mark>IMP3</mark> may potentially be a new therapeutic target for SCC.
Identification of <mark>haptoglobin</mark> peptide as a novel serum biomarker for lung squamous cell carcinoma by serum proteome and peptidome profiling.
To date, a number of potential biomarkers for lung squamous cell cancer (SCC) have been identified; however, sensitive biomarkers are currently lacking to detect early stage SCC due to low sensitivity and specificity.
In the present study, we compared the 7 serum proteomic profiles of 11 SCC patients, 7 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and 7 healthy smokers as controls to identify potential serum biomarkers associated with SCC and COPD.
Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass-spectrometric analysis (MS) using an affinity column revealed two candidate proteins, <mark>haptoglobin</mark> (<mark>HP</mark>) and <mark>apolipoprotein 4</mark>, as biomarkers of SCC, and <mark>α-1-antichymotrypsin</mark> as a marker of COPD.
The iTRAQ technique was also used to identify SCC-specific peptides.
<mark>HP</mark> protein expression was significantly higher in SCC patients than in COPD patients.
Furthermore, two <mark>HP</mark> protein peptides showed significantly higher serum levels in SCC patients than in COPD patients.
We established novel polyclonal antibodies for the two <mark>HP</mark> peptides and subsequently a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the quantification of these specific peptides in patient and control sera.
The sensitivity of detection by ELISA of one <mark>HP</mark> peptide (HP216) was 70% of SCC patients, 40% of COPDs patients and 13% of healthy controls.
We also measured CYFRA, a <mark>cytokeratin</mark> fragment clinically used as an SCC tumor marker, in all the 28 cases and found CYFRA was detected in only seven SCC cases.
However, when the measurement of HP216 was combined with that of CYFRA, 100% (10 of 10 patients) of SCC cases were detected.
Our proteomic profiling demonstrates that the SCC-specific <mark>HP</mark> peptide HP216 may potentially be used as a diagnostic biomarker for SCC.
Genetic alterations and their clinical implications in gastric cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis revealed by whole-exome sequencing of malignant ascites.
Peritoneal carcinomatosis accompanied by malignant ascites is a major cause of death of advanced gastric cancer (GC).
To comprehensively characterize the underlying genomic events involved in GC peritoneal carcinomatosis, we analyzed whole-exome sequences of normal gastric tissues, primary tumors, and malignant ascites from eight GC patients.
We identified a unique mutational signature biased toward C-to-A substitutions in malignant ascites.
In contrast, the patients who received treatment of adjuvant chemotherapy showed a high rate of C-to-T substitutions along with hypermutation in malignant ascites.
Comparative analysis revealed several candidate mutations for GC peritoneal carcinomatosis: recurrent mutations in <mark>COL4A6</mark>, <mark>INTS2</mark>, and <mark>PTPN13</mark>; mutations in druggable genes including <mark>TEP1</mark>, <mark>PRKCD</mark>, <mark>BRAF</mark>, <mark>ERBB4</mark>, <mark>PIK3CA</mark>, <mark>HDAC9</mark>, <mark>FYN</mark>, <mark>FASN</mark>, <mark>BIRC2</mark>, <mark>FLT3</mark>, <mark>ROCK1</mark>, <mark>CD22</mark>, and <mark>PIK3C2B</mark>; and mutations in metastasis-associated genes including <mark>TNFSF12</mark>, <mark>L1CAM</mark>, <mark>DIAPH3</mark>, <mark>ROCK1</mark>, <mark>TGFBR1</mark>, <mark>MYO9B</mark>, <mark>NR4A1</mark>, and <mark>RHOA</mark>.
Notably, gene ontology analysis revealed the significant enrichment of mutations in the <mark>Rho</mark>-<mark>ROCK</mark> signaling pathway-associated biological processes in malignant ascites.
At least four of the eight patients acquired somatic mutations in the <mark>Rho</mark>-<mark>ROCK</mark> pathway components, suggesting the possible relevance of this pathway to GC peritoneal carcinomatosis.
These results provide a genome-wide molecular understanding of GC peritoneal carcinomatosis and its clinical implications, thereby facilitating the development of effective therapeutics.
<mark>Long non-coding RNA</mark> <mark>AK027294</mark> involves in the process of proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells.
This study is aimed to investigate the differentially expressed <mark>long non-coding RNAs</mark> (<mark>lncRNAs</mark>) in colorectal cancer and its potential biological function.
Colorectal adenoma is the precancerous lesions of colorectal cancer, so in this study, we used colorectal adenoma as negative control.
The global <mark>lncRNA</mark> expression profile in colorectal cancer and adenoma was evaluated by bioinformatics.
The biological functions and potential mechanism of <mark>AK027294</mark> were investigated in HCT116, HCT8, and SW480 colorectal cancer cells.
A total of 135 <mark>lncRNAs</mark> were found to be differentially expressed in colorectal cancer and adenoma tissues.
Among them, 71 <mark>lncRNAs</mark> were up-regulated and 64 <mark>lncRNAs</mark> were down-regulated.
Especially, <mark>AK027294</mark> was found to be highly expressed in colorectal cancer tissues compared with colorectal adenoma tissues (fold change is 184.5).
Our results indicated that <mark>AK027294</mark> down-regulation significantly inhibited colorectal cancer cells proliferation and migration, but promoted cell apoptosis (P < 0.05).
The potential mechanism of <mark>AK027294</mark> might be associated with the regulation of <mark>caspase-3</mark>, <mark>caspase-8</mark>, <mark>Bcl-2</mark>, <mark>MMP12</mark>, <mark>MMP9</mark>, and <mark>TWIST</mark>.
The <mark>lncRNA</mark> expression profile in colorectal cancer suggests <mark>lncRNAs</mark> may play important roles in the occurrence and progression of colorectal cancer.
<mark>AK027294</mark> is highly expressed in colorectal cancer and closely correlates with colorectal cells proliferation, migration, and apoptosis.
Identification of the <mark>dopamine transporter</mark> <mark>SLC6A3</mark> as a biomarker for patients with renal cell carcinoma.
BACKGROUND: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is among the most common human malignancies.
METHODS: In order to provide better understanding of the molecular biology of ccRCC and to identify potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarker and therapeutic targets, we utilized a microarray to profile mRNA expression of corresponding normal and malignant renal tissues.
Real-time PCR, Western Blot and immunohistochemistry were applied to study the expression of candidate biomarkers.
ccRCC cell lines were treated with sertraline to inhibit the <mark>dopamine transporter</mark> <mark>SLC6A3</mark>.
RESULTS: Differential expression of fourteen mRNAs, yet not studied in ccRCC in depth, was confirmed using qPCR (upregulation: <mark>SLC6A3</mark>, <mark>NPTX2</mark>, <mark>TNFAIP6</mark>, <mark>NDUFA4L2</mark>, <mark>ENPP3</mark>, <mark>FABP6</mark>, <mark>SPINK13</mark>; downregulation: <mark>FXYD4</mark>, <mark>SLC12A1</mark>, <mark>KNG1</mark>, <mark>NPHS2</mark>, <mark>SLC13A3</mark>, <mark>GCGR</mark>, <mark>PLG</mark>).
Up-/downregulation was also confirmed for <mark>FXYD4</mark>, <mark>KNG1</mark>, <mark>NPTX2</mark> and <mark>SLC12A1</mark> by Western Blot on the protein level.
In contrast to the mRNA expression, protein expression of the <mark>dopamine transporter</mark> <mark>SLC6A3</mark> was lower in ccRCC compared to normal renal tissue.
Immunohistochemistry indicated that this decrease was due to higher concentrations of <mark>SLC6A3</mark> in the proximal tubules.
Immunohistochemical analyses further demonstrated that high <mark>SLC6A3</mark> expression in ccRCC tissue was correlated with a shorter period of recurrence-free survival following surgery.
Treatment of ccRCC cells with the <mark>SLC6A3</mark> inhibitor sertraline induced dose-dependent cell-death.
CONCLUSION: Our study identified several novel biomarkers with diagnostic potential and further investigations on sertraline as therapeutic agent in ccRCC patients are warranted.
<mark>Adiponectin</mark> Upregulates <mark>MiR-133a</mark> in Cardiac Hypertrophy through <mark>AMPK</mark> Activation and Reduced <mark>ERK1/2</mark> Phosphorylation.
<mark>Adiponectin</mark> and <mark>miR-133a</mark> are key regulators in cardiac hypertrophy.
However, whether <mark>APN</mark> has a potential effect on <mark>miR-133a</mark> remains unclear.
In this study, we aimed to investigate whether <mark>APN</mark> could regulate <mark>miR-133a</mark> expression in <mark>Angiotensin II</mark> (<mark>Ang II</mark>) induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro.
Lentiviral-mediated <mark>adiponectin</mark> treatment attenuated cardiac hypertrophy induced by <mark>Ang II</mark> infusion in male wistar rats as determined by reduced cell surface area and mRNA levels of <mark>atrial natriuretic peptide</mark> (<mark>ANF</mark>) and <mark>brain natriuretic peptide</mark> (<mark>BNP</mark>), also the reduced left ventricular end-diastolic posterior wall thickness (LVPWd) and end-diastolic interventricular septal thickness (IVSd).
Meanwhile, <mark>APN</mark> elevated <mark>miR-133a</mark> level which was downregulated by <mark>Ang II</mark>.
To further investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we treated neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) with recombinant rat <mark>APN</mark> before <mark>Ang II</mark> stimulation.
Pretreating cells with recombinant <mark>APN</mark> promoted <mark>AMP-activated protein kinase</mark> (<mark>AMPK</mark>) phosphorylation and inhibited <mark>ERK</mark> activation.
By using the inhibitor of <mark>AMPK</mark> or a lentiviral vector expressing <mark>AMPK</mark> short hairpin RNA (shRNA) cancelled the positive effect of <mark>APN</mark> on <mark>miR-133a</mark>.
The <mark>ERK</mark> inhibitor PD98059 reversed the downregulation of <mark>miR-133a</mark> induced by <mark>Ang II</mark>.
These results indicated that the <mark>AMPK</mark> activation and <mark>ERK</mark> inhibition were responsible for the positive effect of <mark>APN</mark> on <mark>miR-133a</mark>.
Furthermore, <mark>adiponectin receptor 1</mark> (<mark>AdipoR1</mark>) mRNA expression was inhibited by <mark>Ang II</mark> stimulation.
The positive effects of <mark>APN</mark> on <mark>AMPK</mark> activation and <mark>miR-133a</mark>, and the inhibitory effect on <mark>ERK</mark> phosphorylation were inhibited in NRVMs transfected with lentiviral <mark>AdipoR1</mark>shRNA.
In addition, <mark>APN</mark> depressed the elevated expression of <mark>connective tissue growth factor</mark> (<mark>CTGF</mark>), a direct target of <mark>miR-133a</mark>, through the <mark>AMPK</mark> pathway.
Taken together, our data indicated that <mark>APN</mark> reversed <mark>miR-133a</mark> levels through <mark>AMPK</mark> activation, reduced <mark>ERK1/2</mark> phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes stimulated with <mark>Ang II</mark>, revealing a previously undemonstrated and important link between <mark>APN</mark> and <mark>miR-133a</mark>.
<mark>Transgelin</mark> increases metastatic potential of colorectal cancer cells in vivo and alters expression of genes involved in cell motility.
BACKGROUND: <mark>Transgelin</mark> is an <mark>actin-binding protein</mark> that promotes motility in normal cells.
Although the role of <mark>transgelin</mark> in cancer is controversial, a number of studies have shown that elevated levels correlate with aggressive tumor behavior, advanced stage, and poor prognosis.
Here we sought to determine the role of <mark>transgelin</mark> more directly by determining whether experimental manipulation of <mark>transgelin</mark> levels in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells led to changes in metastatic potential in vivo.
METHODS: Isogenic CRC cell lines that differ in <mark>transgelin</mark> expression were characterized using in vitro assays of growth and invasiveness and a mouse tail vein assay of experimental metastasis.
Downstream effects of <mark>transgelin</mark> overexpression were investigated by gene expression profiling and quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: Stable overexpression of <mark>transgelin</mark> in RKO cells, which have low endogenous levels, led to increased invasiveness, growth at low density, and growth in soft agar.
Overexpression also led to an increase in the number and size of lung metastases in the mouse tail vein injection model.
Similarly, attenuation of <mark>transgelin</mark> expression in HCT116 cells, which have high endogenous levels, decreased metastases in the same model.
Investigation of mRNA expression patterns showed that <mark>transgelin</mark> <mark>overexpression altered the</mark> levels of approximately 250 other transcripts, with over-representation of genes that affect function of <mark>actin</mark> or other <mark>cytoskeletal proteins</mark>.
Changes included increases in <mark>HOOK1</mark>, <mark>SDCCAG8</mark>, <mark>ENAH</mark>/<mark>Mena</mark>, and <mark>TNS1</mark> and decreases in <mark>EMB</mark>, <mark>BCL11B</mark>, and <mark>PTPRD</mark>.
CONCLUSIONS: Increases or decreases in <mark>transgelin</mark> levels have reciprocal effects on tumor cell behavior, with higher expression promoting metastasis.
Chronic overexpression influences steady-state levels of mRNAs for metastasis-related genes.
Repression of <mark>Wnt</mark>/<mark>β-catenin</mark> response elements by <mark>p63</mark> (<mark>TP63</mark>).
Submitted: <mark>TP63</mark> (<mark>p63</mark>), a member of the tumor suppressor <mark>TP53</mark> (<mark>p53</mark>) gene family, is expressed in keratinocyte stem cells and well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas to maintain cellular potential for growth and differentiation.
Controversially, activation of the <mark>Wnt</mark>/<mark>β-catenin</mark> signaling by <mark>p63</mark> (Patturajan M. et al., 2002, Cancer Cells) and inhibition of the target gene expression (Drewelus I. et al., 2010, Cell Cycle) have been reported.
Upon <mark>p63</mark> RNA-silencing in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lines, a few <mark>Wnt</mark> target gene expression substantially increased, while several target genes moderately decreased.
Although <mark>ΔNp63α</mark>, the most abundant isoform of <mark>p63</mark>, appeared to interact with <mark>protein phosphatase</mark> <mark>PP2A</mark>, neither <mark>GSK-3β</mark> phosphorylation nor <mark>β-catenin</mark> nuclear localization was altered by the loss of <mark>p63</mark>.
As reported earlier, <mark>ΔNp63α</mark> enhanced <mark>β-catenin</mark>-dependent luc gene expression from pGL3-OT having 3 artificial <mark>Wnt</mark> response elements (WREs).
However, this activation was detectable only in HEK293 cells examined so far, and involved a <mark>p53</mark> family-related sequence 5' to the WREs.
In <mark>Wnt3</mark>-expressing SAOS-2 cells, <mark>ΔNp63α</mark> rather strongly inhibited transcription of pGL3-OT.
Importantly, <mark>ΔNp63α</mark> repressed WREs isolated from the regulatory regions of <mark>MMP7</mark>.
<mark>ΔNp63α</mark>-<mark>TCF4</mark> association occurred in their soluble forms in the nucleus.
Furthermore, <mark>p63</mark> and <mark>TCF4</mark> coexisted at a WRE of <mark>MMP7</mark> on the chromatin, where <mark>β-catenin</mark> recruitment was attenuated.
The combined results indicate that <mark>ΔNp63α</mark> serves as a repressor that regulates <mark>β-catenin</mark>-mediated gene expression.
<mark>CFI</mark>-rs7356506 polymorphisms associated with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome.
PURPOSE: <mark>Complement factor I</mark> (<mark>CFI</mark>) plays an important role in complement activation pathways and is known to affect the development of uveitis.
The present study was performed to investigate the existence of an association between <mark>CFI</mark> genetic polymorphisms and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome.
METHODS: A total of 100 patients diagnosed with VKH syndrome and 300 healthy controls were recruited for the study.
Two milliliters of peripheral blood were collected in a sterile anticoagulative tube.
<mark>CFI</mark>-rs7356506 polymorphisms were genotyped using Sequenom MassARRAY technology.
Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between patients and controls using a χ(2) test.
The analyses were stratified for recurrent status, complicated cataract status, and steroid-sensitive status.
RESULTS: No significant association was found between <mark>CFI</mark>-rs7356506 polymorphisms and VKH syndrome.
However, patients with recurrent VKH syndrome had lower frequencies of the G allele and GG homozygosity in <mark>CFI</mark>-rs7356506 when compared to the controls (p=0.016, odds ratio [OR]=0.429, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.212-0.871; p=0.014, OR=0.364, 95% CI=0.158-0.837, respectively).
Furthermore, there were significant decreases in the frequencies of the G allele and GG homozygosity in <mark>CFI</mark>-rs7356506 in patients with VKH syndrome with complicated cataract compared to the controls (p<0.001, OR=0.357, 95% CI=0.197-0.648; p<0.001, OR=0.273, 95% CI=0.135-0.551, respectively).
Nevertheless, no significant association with patients with VKH syndrome in steroid-sensitive statuses was detected for <mark>CFI</mark>-rs7356506 polymorphisms.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that <mark>CFI</mark> polymorphisms are not significantly associated with VKH syndrome; nevertheless, we identified a trend for the association of <mark>CFI</mark>-7356506 with VKH syndrome that depends on the recurrent status and the complicated cataract status but not on the steroid-sensitive status.
<mark>Cdc45</mark> is limiting for replication initiation in humans.
<mark>Cdc45</mark> is an essential protein that together with <mark>Mcm2-7</mark> and <mark>GINS</mark> forms the eukaryotic replicative helicase <mark>CMG</mark>.
<mark>Cdc45</mark> seems to be rate limiting for the initial unwinding or firing of replication origins.
In line with this view, <mark>Cdc45</mark>-overexpressing cells fired at least twice as many origins as control cells.
However, these cells displayed an about 2-fold diminished fork elongation rate, a pronounced asymmetry of replication fork extension, and an early S phase arrest.
This was accompanied by <mark>H2AX</mark>-phosphorylation and subsequent apoptosis.
Unexpectedly, we did not observe increased <mark>ATR</mark>/<mark>Chk1</mark> signaling but rather a mild <mark>ATM</mark>/<mark>Chk2</mark> response.
In addition, we detected accumulation of long stretches of single-stranded DNA, a hallmark of replication catastrophe.
We conclude that increased origin firing by upregulated <mark>Cdc45</mark> caused exhaustion of the single-strand binding protein <mark>RPA</mark>, which in consequence diminished the <mark>ATR</mark>/<mark>Chk1</mark> response; the subsequently occurring fork breaks led to an <mark>ATM</mark>/<mark>Chk2</mark> mediated phosphorylation of <mark>H2AX</mark> and eventually to apoptosis.
Reactivation of epigenetically silenced <mark>miR-124</mark> reverses the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and inhibits invasion in endometrial cancer cells via the direct repression of <mark>IQGAP1</mark> expression.
Overexpression of <mark>IQGAP1</mark> and microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation are frequent in human tumors, but little is known about the role of <mark>IQGAP1</mark> and its relationship to miRNA in endometrial carcinogenesis.
We demonstrate that <mark>IQGAP1</mark> activates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program and that <mark>miR-124</mark> directly represses <mark>IQGAP1</mark> expression in endometrial cancer (EC) cells.
The overexpression of <mark>IQGAP1</mark> stimulates EMT features and enhances migration, invasion and proliferation of EC cells, whereas knocking down <mark>IQGAP1</mark> expression reverses EMT and inhibits these malignant properties.
Using miRNA microarray profiling, we identified 29 miRNAs (<mark>let-7b</mark>, <mark>let-7f</mark>, <mark>miR-10b</mark>, <mark>miR-15b</mark>, <mark>miR-23a</mark>, <mark>miR-24</mark>, <mark>miR-25</mark>, <mark>miR-27a</mark>, <mark>miR-29b</mark>, <mark>miR-30a</mark>-5p, <mark>miR-34a</mark>, <mark>miR-124</mark>, <mark>miR-127</mark>, <mark>miR-130b</mark>, <mark>miR-148a</mark>, <mark>miR-155</mark>, <mark>miR-191</mark>*, <mark>miR-194</mark>, <mark>miR-224</mark>, <mark>miR-362</mark>, <mark>miR-409</mark>-3p, <mark>miR-422b</mark>, <mark>miR-424</mark>, <mark>miR-453</mark>, <mark>miR-497</mark>, <mark>miR-518d</mark>, <mark>miR-518f</mark>*, <mark>miR-526a</mark> and <mark>miR-656</mark>) that are significantly down-regulated in an in vitro-selected highly invasive derivative cell line (HEC-50-HI) relative to the parental HEC-50 cells.
We further identified <mark>miR-124</mark> as a direct regulator of <mark>IQGAP1</mark> in EC cells.
Enforced expression of <mark>miR-124</mark> suppresses EC cell invasion and proliferation.
The expression of <mark>IQGAP1</mark> mRNA was significantly elevated in EC tissues, while the expression of <mark>miR-124</mark> was decreased.
The downregulation of <mark>miR-124</mark> correlates with a poor survival outcome for patients with EC.
Treating EC cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine increased <mark>miR-124</mark> expression and down-regulated <mark>IQGAP1</mark> levels.
Our data suggest that <mark>IQGAP1</mark> promotes EMT, migration and invasion of EC cells.
<mark>MiR-124</mark>, a novel tumor suppressor miRNA that is epigenetically silenced in EC, can reverse EMT and the invasive properties, by attenuating the expression of the <mark>IQGAP1</mark> oncogene.
Multiple Transduction Pathways Mediate <mark>Thyrotropin Receptor</mark> Signaling in Preosteoblast-Like Cells.
It has been shown that the <mark>TSH receptor</mark> (<mark>TSHR</mark>) couples to a number of different signaling pathways, although the <mark>Gs</mark>-cAMP pathway has been considered primary.
Here, we measured the effects of TSH on bone marker mRNA and protein expression in preosteoblast-like U2OS cells stably expressing <mark>TSHRs</mark>.
We determined which signaling cascades are involved in the regulation of <mark>IL-11</mark>, <mark>osteopontin</mark> (<mark>OPN</mark>), and <mark>alkaline phosphatase</mark> (<mark>ALPL</mark>).
We demonstrated that TSH-induced up-regulation of <mark>IL-11</mark> is primarily mediated via the <mark>Gs</mark> pathway as <mark>IL-11</mark> was up-regulated by forskolin (FSK), an <mark>adenylyl cyclase</mark> activator, and inhibited by <mark>protein kinase A</mark> inhibitor H-89 and by silencing of <mark>Gαs</mark> by small interfering RNA.
<mark>OPN</mark> levels were not affected by FSK, but its up-regulation was inhibited by <mark>TSHR</mark>/<mark>Gi</mark>-uncoupling by pertussis toxin.
Pertussis toxin decreased <mark>p38 MAPK kinase</mark> phosphorylation, and a <mark>p38</mark> inhibitor and small interfering RNA knockdown of <mark>p38α</mark> inhibited <mark>OPN</mark> induction by TSH.
Up-regulation of <mark>ALPL</mark> expression required high doses of TSH (EC50 = 395nM), whereas low doses (EC50 = 19nM) were inhibitory.
FSK-stimulated cAMP production decreased basal <mark>ALPL</mark> expression, whereas <mark>protein kinase A</mark> inhibition by H-89 and silencing of <mark>Gαs</mark> increased basal levels of <mark>ALPL</mark>.
Knockdown of <mark>Gαq/11</mark> and a <mark>protein kinase C</mark> inhibitor decreased TSH-stimulated up-regulation of <mark>ALPL</mark>, whereas a <mark>protein kinase C</mark> activator increased <mark>ALPL</mark> levels.
A <mark>MAPK</mark> inhibitor and silencing of <mark>ERK1/2</mark> inhibited TSH-stimulated <mark>ALPL</mark> expression.
We conclude that TSH regulates expression of different bone markers via distinct signaling pathways.
A Role for Androgens in Epithelial Proliferation and Formation of Glands in the Mouse Uterus.
The endometrium consists of stromal and epithelial compartments (luminal and glandular) with distinct functions in the regulation of uterine homeostasis.
Ovarian sex steroids, namely 17β-estradiol and progesterone, play essential roles in modulating uterine cell proliferation, stromal-epithelial cross-talk and differentiation in preparation for pregnancy.
The effect of androgens on uterine function remains poorly understood.
The current study investigated the effect of the non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on mouse endometrial function.
Ovx female mice were given a single sc injection (short treatment) or 7 daily injections (long treatment) of vehicle alone (5% ethanol, 0.4% methylcellulose) or vehicle with the addition of 0.2 mg DHT (n=8/group) and a single injection of bromodeoxyuridine 2 hours prior to tissue recovery.
Treatment with DHT increased uterine weight, the area of the endometrial compartment and immunoexpression of the <mark>androgen receptor</mark> in the luminal and glandular epithelium.
Treatment-dependent proliferation of epithelial cells was identified by immunostaining for <mark>MKi67</mark> and bromodeoxyuridine.
Real-time PCR identified significant DHT-dependent changes in the concentrations of mRNAs encoded by genes implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle (<mark>Wee1</mark>, <mark>Ccnd1</mark>, <mark>Rb1</mark>) and stromal-epithelial interactions (<mark>Wnt4</mark>, <mark>Wnt5a</mark>, <mark>Wnt7a</mark>, <mark>Cdh1</mark>, <mark>Vcl</mark>, <mark>Igf1</mark>, <mark>Prl8</mark>, <mark>Prlr</mark>) as well as a striking effect on the number of endometrial glands.
This study has revealed a novel role for androgens in regulating uterine function with an effect on the glandular compartment of the endometrium.
This previously unrecognized role for androgens has implications for our understanding of the role of androgens in regulation of endometrial function and fertility in women.
Bacterial DNA Protects Monocytic Cells against HIV-<mark>Vpr</mark>-Induced Mitochondrial Membrane Depolarization.
Monocytes and macrophages are important HIV reservoirs, as they exhibit marked resistance to apoptosis upon infection.
However, the mechanism underlying resistance to apoptosis in these cells is poorly understood.
Using HIV-viral protein R-52-96 aa peptide (<mark>Vpr</mark>), we show that primary monocytes and THP-1 cells treated with <mark>Vpr</mark> are highly susceptible to mitochondrial depolarization, but develop resistance following stimulation with bacterial DNA or CpG oligodeoxynucleotide.
We have shown that <mark>Vpr</mark>-induced mitochondrial depolarization is mediated by <mark>TNFR-associated factor-1</mark> (<mark>TRAF-1</mark>) and <mark>TRAF-2</mark> degradation and subsequent activation of <mark>caspase-8</mark>, <mark>Bid</mark>, and <mark>Bax</mark>.
To provide the mechanism governing such resistance to mitochondrial depolarization, our results show that prior stimulation with CpG oligodeoxynucleotide or Escherichia coli DNA prevented: 1) <mark>TRAF-1/2</mark> downregulation; 2) activation of <mark>caspase-8</mark>, <mark>Bid</mark>, and <mark>Bax</mark>; and 3) subsequent mitochondrial depolarization and release of <mark>apoptosis-inducing factor</mark> and <mark>cytochrome c</mark> Furthermore, this protection was mediated by upregulation of <mark>antiapoptotic protein</mark> (<mark>c-IAP-2</mark>) through <mark>calmodulin-dependent kinase-II</mark> activation.
Thus, <mark>c-IAP-2</mark> may prevent <mark>Vpr</mark>-mediated mitochondrial depolarization through stabilizing <mark>TRAF-1/2</mark> expression and sequential inhibition of <mark>caspase-8</mark>, <mark>Bid</mark>, and <mark>Bax</mark>.
<mark>MOL1</mark> is required for cambium homeostasis in Arabidopsis.
Plants maintain pools of pluripotent stem cells which allow them to constantly produce new tissues and organs.
Stem cell homeostasis in shoot and root tips depends on negative regulation by ligand-receptor pairs of the <mark>CLE peptide</mark> and <mark>leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase</mark> (<mark>LRR-RLK</mark>) families.
However, regulation of the cambium, the stem cell niche required for lateral growth of shoots and roots, is poorly characterized.
Here we show that the <mark>LRR-RLK</mark> <mark>MOL1</mark> is necessary for cambium homeostasis in Arabidopsis thaliana.
By employing promoter reporter lines, we reveal that <mark>MOL1</mark> is active in a domain that is distinct from the domain of the positively acting <mark>CLE41</mark>/<mark>PXY</mark> signaling module.
In particular, we show that <mark>MOL1</mark> acts in an opposing manner to the <mark>CLE41</mark>/<mark>PXY</mark> module and that changing the domain or level of <mark>MOL1</mark> expression both result in disturbed cambium organization.
Underlining discrete roles of <mark>MOL1</mark> and <mark>PXY</mark>, both <mark>LRR-RLKs</mark> are not able to replace each other when their expression domains are interchanged.
Furthermore, <mark>MOL1</mark> but not <mark>PXY</mark> is able to rescue <mark>CLV1</mark> deficiency in the shoot apical meristem.
By identifying genes mis-expressed in <mark>mol1</mark> mutants, we demonstrate that <mark>MOL1</mark> represses genes associated with stress-related ethylene and jasmonic acid hormone signaling pathways which have known roles in coordinating lateral growth of the Arabidopsis stem.
Our findings provide evidence that common regulatory mechanisms in different plant stem cell niches are adapted to specific niche anatomies and emphasize the importance of a complex spatial organization of intercellular signaling cascades for a strictly bidirectional tissue production.
Knockdown of <mark>Carboxypeptidase A6</mark> in Zebrafish Larvae Reduces Response to Seizure-Inducing Drugs and Causes Changes in the Level of mRNAs Encoding Signaling Molecules.
<mark>Carboxypeptidase A6</mark> (<mark>CPA6</mark>) is an extracellular matrix metallocarboxypeptidase that modulates peptide and protein function by removal of hydrophobic C-terminal amino acids.
Mutations in the human <mark>CPA6</mark> gene that reduce enzymatic activity in the extracellular matrix are associated with febrile seizures, temporal lobe epilepsy, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.
The characterization of these human mutations suggests a dominant mode of inheritance by haploinsufficiency through loss of function mutations, however the total number of humans with pathologic mutations in <mark>CPA6</mark> identified to date remains small.
To better understand the relationship between <mark>CPA6</mark> and seizures we investigated the effects of morpholino knockdown of <mark>cpa6</mark> mRNA in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae.
Knockdown of <mark>cpa6</mark> mRNA resulted in resistance to the effect of seizure-inducing drugs pentylenetetrazole and pilocarpine on swimming behaviors.
Knockdown of <mark>cpa6</mark> mRNA also reduced the levels of mRNAs encoding neuropeptide precursors (<mark>bdnf</mark>, <mark>npy</mark>, <mark>chga</mark>, <mark>pcsk1nl</mark>, <mark>tac1</mark>, <mark>nts</mark>, <mark>edn1</mark>), a <mark>neuropeptide processing enzyme</mark> (<mark>cpe</mark>), <mark>transcription factor</mark> (<mark>c-fos</mark>), and molecules implicated in glutamatergic signaling (<mark>grin1a</mark> and <mark>slc1a2b</mark>).
Treatment of zebrafish embryos with 60 mM pilocarpine for 1 hour led to reductions in levels of many of the same mRNAs when measured 1 day after pilocarpine exposure, except for <mark>c-fos</mark> which was elevated 1 day after pilocarpine treatment.
Pilocarpine treatment, like <mark>cpa6</mark> knockdown, led to a reduced sensitivity to pentylenetetrazole when tested 1 day after pilocarpine treatment.
Taken together, these results add to mounting evidence that peptidergic systems participate in the biological effects of seizure-inducing drugs, and are the first in vivo demonstration of the molecular and behavioral consequences of <mark>cpa6</mark> insufficiency.
<mark>NF-κB</mark> functions as a molecular link between tumor cells and Th1/Tc1 T cells in the tumor microenvironment to exert radiation-mediated tumor suppression.
Radiation modulates both tumor cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment to exert its anti-tumor activity; however, the molecular connection between tumor cells and immune cells that mediates radiation-exerted tumor suppression activity in the tumor microenvironment is largely unknown.
We report here that radiation induces rapid activation of the <mark>p65</mark>/<mark>p50</mark> and <mark>p50</mark>/<mark>p50</mark> <mark>NF-κB</mark> complexes in human soft tissue sarcoma (STS) cells.
Radiation-activated <mark>p65</mark>/<mark>p50</mark> and <mark>p50</mark>/<mark>p50</mark> bind to the <mark>TNFα</mark> promoter to activate its transcription in STS cells.
Radiation-induced <mark>TNFα</mark> induces tumor cell death in an autocrine manner.
A sublethal dose of Smac mimetic BV6 induces <mark>cIAP1</mark> and <mark>cIAP2</mark> degradation to increase tumor cell sensitivity to radiation-induced cell death in vitro and to enhance radiation-mediated suppression of STS xenografts in vivo.
Inhibition of <mark>caspases</mark>, <mark>RIP1</mark>, or <mark>RIP3</mark> blocks radiation/<mark>TNFα</mark>-induced cell death, whereas inhibition of <mark>RIP1</mark> blocks <mark>TNFα</mark>-induced <mark>caspase</mark> activation, suggesting that <mark>caspases</mark> and <mark>RIP1</mark> act sequentially to mediate the non-compensatory cell death pathways.
Furthermore, we determined in a syngeneic sarcoma mouse model that radiation up-regulates <mark>IRF3</mark>, <mark>IFNβ</mark>, and the T cell chemokines <mark>CCL2</mark> and <mark>CCL5</mark> in the tumor microenvironment, which are associated with activation and increased infiltration of Th1/Tc1 T cells in the tumor microenvironment.
Moreover, tumor-infiltrating T cells are in their active form since both the <mark>perforin</mark> and <mark>FasL</mark> pathways are activated in irradiated tumor tissues.
Consequently, combined BV6 and radiation completely suppressed tumor growth in vivo.
Therefore, radiation-induced <mark>NF-κB</mark> functions as a molecular link between tumor cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment for radiation-mediated tumor suppression.
Yeast <mark>Gdt1</mark> is a Golgi-localized calcium transporter required for stress-induced calcium signaling and protein glycosylation.
Calcium signaling depends on a tightly regulated set of pumps, exchangers, and channels that are responsible for controlling calcium fluxes between the different subcellular compartments of the eukaryotic cell.
We have recently reported that two members of the highly-conserved <mark>UPF0016</mark> family, human <mark>TMEM165</mark> and budding yeast <mark>Gdt1p</mark>, are functionally related and might form a new group of Golgi-localized <mark>cation/Ca(2+) exchangers</mark>.
Defects in the human protein <mark>TMEM165</mark> are known to cause a subtype of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation.
Using an assay based on the heterologous expression of <mark>GDT1</mark> in the bacterium Lactococcus lactis, we demonstrated the calcium transport activity of <mark>Gdt1p</mark>.
We observed a Ca(2+) uptake activity in cells expressing <mark>GDT1</mark>, which was dependent on the external pH, indicating that <mark>Gdt1p</mark> may act as a <mark>Ca(2+)/H(+) antiporter</mark>.
In yeast, we found that <mark>Gdt1p</mark> controls cellular calcium stores and plays a major role in the calcium response induced by osmotic shock when the Golgi <mark>calcium pump</mark>, <mark>Pmr1p</mark>, is absent.
Importantly, we also discovered that, in the presence of a high concentration of external calcium, <mark>Gdt1p</mark> is required for glycosylation of <mark>carboxypeptidase Y</mark> and the <mark>glucanosyltransferase</mark> <mark>Gas1p</mark>.
Finally we showed that glycosylation process is restored by providing more Mn(2+) to the cells.
Anti-<mark>IL-20</mark> monoclonal antibody promotes bone fracture healing through regulating <mark>IL-20</mark>-mediated osteoblastogenesis.
Bone loss and skeletal fragility in bone fracture are caused by an imbalance in bone remodeling.
The current challenge in bone fracture healing is to promote osteoblastogenesis and bone formation.
We aimed to explore the role of <mark>IL-20</mark> in osteoblastogenesis, osteoblast differentiation and bone fracture.
Serum <mark>IL-20</mark> was significantly correlated with serum <mark>sclerostin</mark> in patients with bone fracture.
In a mouse model, anti-<mark>IL-20</mark> monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7E increased bone formation during fracture healing.
In vitro, <mark>IL-20</mark> inhibited osteoblastogenesis by upregulating <mark>scleros<mark>sclerostin</mark>> and downregulating <mark>osterix</mark> (<mark>OSX</mark>), <mark>RUNX2</mark>, and <mark>osteoprotegerin</mark> (<mark>OPG</mark>).
<mark>IL-20R1</mark> deficiency attenuated <mark>IL-20</mark>-mediated inhibition of osteoblast differentiation and maturation and reduced the healing time after a bone fracture.
We conclude that <mark>IL-20</mark> affects bone formation and downregulates osteoblastogenesis by modulating <mark>sclerostin</mark>, <mark>OSX</mark>, <mark>RUNX2</mark>, and <mark>OPG</mark> on osteoblasts.
Our results demonstrated that <mark>IL-20</mark> is involved in osteoregulation and anti-<mark>IL-20</mark> mAb is a potential therapeutic for treating bone fracture or metabolic bone diseases.
<mark>NOTCH1</mark> and <mark>SOX10</mark> are Essential for Proliferation and Radiation Resistance of Cancer Stem-Like Cells in Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma.
PURPOSE: Although the existence of cancer stem cells (CSC) in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) has been proposed, lack of assays for their propagation and uncertainty about molecular markers prevented their characterization.
Our objective was to isolate CSC from ACC and provide insight into signaling pathways that support their propagation.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To isolate CSC from ACC and characterize them, we used <mark>ROCK</mark> inhibitor-supplemented cell culture, immunomagnetic cell sorting, andin vitro/in vivoassays for CSC viability and tumorigenicity.
RESULTS: We identified in ACC <mark>CD133</mark>-positive CSC that expressed <mark>NOTCH1</mark> and <mark>SOX10</mark>, formed spheroids, and initiated tumors in nude mice.
<mark>CD133</mark>(+)ACC cells produced activated <mark>NOTCH1</mark> (<mark>N1ICD</mark>) and generated <mark>CD133</mark>(-)cells that expressed <mark>JAG1</mark> as well as neural differentiation factors <mark>NR2F1</mark>, <mark>NR2F2</mark>, and <mark>p27Kip1</mark>.
Knockdowns of<mark>NOTCH1</mark>, <mark>SOX10</mark>, and their common effector<mark>FABP7</mark>had negative effects on each other, inhibited spheroidogenesis, and induced cell death pointing at their essential roles in CSC maintenance.
Downstream effects of<mark>FABP7</mark>knockdown included suppression of a broad spectrum of genes involved in proliferation, ribosome biogenesis, and metabolism.
Among proliferation-linked <mark>NOTCH1</mark>/<mark>FABP7</mark> targets, we identified <mark>SKP2</mark> and its substrate <mark>p27Kip1</mark>.
A <mark>γ-secretase</mark> inhibitor, DAPT, selectively depleted <mark>CD133</mark>(+)cells, suppressed <mark>N1ICD</mark> and <mark>SKP2</mark>, induced <mark>p27Kip1</mark>, inhibited ACC growthin vivo, and sensitized <mark>CD133</mark>(+)cells to radiation.
CONCLUSIONS: These results establish in the majority of ACC the presence of a previously uncharacterized population of <mark>CD133</mark>(+)cells with neural stem properties, which are driven by <mark>SOX10</mark>, <mark>NOTCH1</mark>, and <mark>FABP7</mark>.
Sensitivity of these cells to <mark>Notch</mark> inhibition and their dependence on <mark>SKP2</mark> offer new opportunities for targeted ACC therapies.
<mark>Galectin-1</mark> dimers can scaffold <mark>Raf</mark>-effectors to increase <mark>H-ras</mark> nanoclustering.
<mark>Galectin-1</mark> (<mark>Gal-1</mark>) dimers crosslink carbohydrates on cell surface receptors.
Carbohydrate-derived inhibitors have been developed for cancer treatment.
Intracellularly, <mark>Gal-1</mark> was suggested to interact with the farnesylated C-terminus of <mark>Ras</mark> thus specifically stabilizing GTP-<mark>H-ras</mark> nanoscale signalling hubs in the membrane, termed nanoclusters.
The latter activity may present an alternative mechanism for how overexpressed <mark>Gal-1</mark> stimulates tumourigenesis.
Here we revise the current model for the interaction of <mark>Gal-1</mark> with <mark>H-ras</mark>.
We show that it indirectly forms a complex with GTP-<mark>H-ras</mark> via a high-affinity interaction with the <mark>Ras</mark> binding domain (RBD) of <mark>Ras</mark> effectors.
A computationally generated model of the <mark>Gal-1</mark>/<mark>C-Raf</mark>-RBD complex is validated by mutational analysis.
Both cellular FRET as well as proximity ligation assay experiments confirm interaction of <mark>Gal-1</mark> with <mark>Raf</mark> proteins in mammalian cells.
Consistently, interference with <mark>H-ras</mark>G12V-effector interactions basically abolishes <mark>H-ras</mark> nanoclustering.
In addition, an intact dimer interface of <mark>Gal-1</mark> is required for it to positively regulate <mark>H-ras</mark>G12V nanoclustering, but negatively <mark>K-ras</mark>G12V nanoclustering.
Our findings suggest stacked dimers of <mark>H-ras</mark>, <mark>Raf</mark> and <mark>Gal-1</mark> as building blocks of GTP-<mark>H-ras</mark>-nanocluster at high <mark>Gal-1</mark> levels.
Based on our results the <mark>Gal-1</mark>/effector interface represents a potential drug target site in diseases with aberrant <mark>Ras</mark> signalling.
<mark>NLRP3</mark> Localizes to the Tubular Epithelium in Human Kidney and Correlates With Outcome in <mark>IgA</mark> Nephropathy.
<mark>Nod-like receptor pyrin domain-containing-3</mark> (<mark>NLRP3</mark>) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of experimental renal injury, yet its characterization in human kidney disease remains largely unexplored.
<mark>NLRP3</mark> expression was evaluated in human kidney biopsies, primary renal tubular cells (HPTC) and correlated to disease outcomes in patients with <mark>IgA</mark> nephropathy (<mark>IgA</mark>N).
<mark>NLRP3</mark> localized to renal tubules in normal human kidney tissue and to mitochondria within HPTC by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence microscopy.
Compared to control kidneys, <mark>NLRP3</mark> gene expression was increased in biopsies of patients with <mark>IgA</mark>N. While <mark>NLRP3</mark> expression in <mark>IgA</mark>N was detected in glomeruli, it remained largely confined to the tubular epithelial compartment.
In vitro <mark>NLRP3</mark> mRNA and protein expression were transiently induced in HPTC by <mark>TGF-β1</mark> but subsequently diminished over time as cells lost their epithelial phenotype in a process regulated by transcription and <mark>ubiquitin</mark>-mediated degradation.
Consistent with the in vitro data, low <mark>NLRP3</mark> mRNA expression in kidney biopsies was associated with a linear trend of higher risk of composite endpoint of doubling serum creatinine and end stage renal disease in patients with <mark>IgA</mark>N. Taken together, these data show that <mark>NLRP3</mark> is primarily a kidney tubule-expressed protein that decreases in abundance in progressive <mark>IgA</mark>N.
Human wild-type full-length <mark>tau</mark> accumulation disrupts mitochondrial dynamics and the functions via increasing <mark>mitofusins</mark>.
Intracellular accumulation of <mark>tau</mark> protein is hallmark of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, the cellular mechanism whereby <mark>tau</mark> accumulation causes neurodegeneration is poorly understood.
Here we report that overexpression of human wild-type full-length <mark>tau</mark> (termed <mark>htau</mark>) disrupted mitochondrial dynamics by enhancing fusion and induced their perinuclear accumulation in HEK293 cells and rat primary hippocampal neurons.
The <mark>htau</mark> accumulation at later stage inhibited mitochondrial functions shown by the decreased ATP level, the ratio of ATP/ADP and complex I activity.
Simultaneously, the cell viability was decreased with retraction of the cellular/neuronal processes.
Further studies demonstrated that <mark>htau</mark> accumulation increased fusion proteins, including <mark>OPA1</mark> and <mark>mitofusins</mark> (<mark>Mfn1</mark>, <mark>Mfn2</mark>) and reduced the ubiquitination of <mark>Mfn2</mark>.
Downregulation of the <mark>mitofusins</mark> by shRNA to ~45% or ~52% of the control levels attenuated the <mark>htau</mark>-enhanced mitochondrial fusion and restored the functions, while downregulation of <mark>OPA1</mark> to ~50% of the control level did not show rescue effects.
Finally, abnormal mitochondrial accumulation and dysfunction were also observed in the brains of <mark>htau</mark> transgenic mice.
Taken together, our data demonstrate that <mark>htau</mark> accumulation decreases cell viability and causes degeneration via enhancing <mark>mitofusin</mark>-associated mitochondrial fusion, which provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tauopathies.
Artery Tertiary Lymphoid Organs Control Multilayered Territorialized Atherosclerosis B-Cell Responses in Aged <mark>ApoE</mark>-/- Mice.
OBJECTIVE: Explore aorta B-cell immunity in aged <mark>apolipoprotein E</mark>-deficient (<mark>ApoE</mark>(-/-)) mice.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: Transcript maps, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, immunofluorescence analyses, cell transfers, and Ig-ELISPOT (enzyme-linked immunospot) assays showed multilayered atherosclerosis B-cell responses in artery tertiary lymphoid organs (ATLOs).
Aging-associated aorta B-cell-related transcriptomes were identified, and transcript atlases revealed highly territorialized B-cell responses in ATLOs versus atherosclerotic lesions: ATLOs showed upregulation of bona fide B-cell genes, including <mark>Cd19</mark>, <mark>Ms4a1</mark> (<mark>Cd20</mark>), <mark>Cd79a/b</mark>, and <mark>Ighm</mark> although intima plaques preferentially expressed molecules involved in non-B effector responses toward B-cell-derived mediators, that is, <mark>Fcgr3</mark> (<mark>Cd16</mark>), <mark>Fcer1g</mark> (<mark>Cd23</mark>), and the <mark>C1q</mark> family.
ATLOs promoted B-cell recruitment.
ATLO B-2 B cells included naive, transitional, follicular, germinal center, switched <mark>IgG1</mark>(+), <mark>IgA</mark>(+), and <mark>IgE</mark>(+) memory cells, plasmablasts, and long-lived plasma cells.
ATLOs recruited large numbers of B-1 cells whose subtypes were skewed toward <mark>interleukin-10</mark>(+) B-1b cells versus <mark>interleukin-10</mark>(-) B-1a cells.
ATLO B-1 cells and plasma cells constitutively produced <mark>IgM</mark> and <mark>IgG</mark> and a fraction of plasma cells expressed <mark>interleukin-10</mark>.
Moreover, <mark>ApoE</mark>(-/-) mice showed increased germinal center B cells in renal lymph nodes, <mark>IgM</mark>-producing plasma cells in the bone marrow, and higher <mark>IgM</mark> and anti-MDA-LDL (malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein) <mark>IgG</mark> serum titers.
CONCLUSIONS: ATLOs orchestrate dichotomic, territorialized, and multilayered B-cell responses in the diseased aorta; germinal center reactions indicate generation of autoimmune B cells within the diseased arterial wall during aging.
On the pivotal role of <mark>PPARα</mark> in adaptation of the heart to hypoxia and why fat in the diet increases hypoxic injury.
The role of <mark>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α</mark> (<mark>PPARα</mark>)-mediated metabolic remodeling in cardiac adaptation to hypoxia has yet to be defined.
Here, mice were housed in hypoxia for 3 wk before in vivo contractile function was measured using cine MRI.
In isolated, perfused hearts, energetics were measured using (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation were measured using [(3)H] labeling.
Compared with a normoxic, chow-fed control mouse heart, hypoxia decreased <mark>PPARα</mark> expression, fatty acid oxidation, and <mark>mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3</mark> (<mark>UCP3</mark>) levels, while increasing glycolysis, all of which served to maintain normal ATP concentrations ([ATP]) and thereby, ejection fractions.
A high-fat diet increased cardiac <mark>PPARα</mark> expression, fatty acid oxidation, and <mark>UCP3</mark> levels with decreased glycolysis.
Hypoxia was unable to alter the high <mark>PPARα</mark> expression or reverse the metabolic changes caused by the high-fat diet, with the result that [ATP] and contractile function decreased significantly.
The adaptive metabolic changes caused by hypoxia in control mouse hearts were found to have occurred already in <mark>PPARα</mark>-deficient (<mark>PPARα</mark>(-/-)) mouse hearts and sustained function in hypoxia despite an inability for further metabolic remodeling.
We conclude that decreased cardiac <mark>PPARα</mark> expression is essential for adaptive metabolic remodeling in hypoxia, but is prevented by dietary fat.-Cole, M. A., Abd Jamil, A. H., Heather, L. C., Murray, A. J., Sutton, E. R., Slingo, M., Sebag-Montefiore, L., Tan, S. C., Aksentijević, D., Gildea, O. S., Stuckey, D. J., Yeoh, K. K., <mark>Carr</mark>, C. A., Evans, R. D., Aasum, E., Schofield, C. J., Ratcliffe, P. J., Neubauer, S., Robbins, P. A., Clarke, K. On the pivotal role of <mark>PPARα</mark> in adaptation of the heart to hypoxia and why fat in the diet increases hypoxic injury.
<mark>Long noncoding RNA</mark> <mark>LINP1</mark> regulates repair of DNA double-strand breaks in triple-negative breast cancer.
<mark>Long noncoding RNAs</mark> (<mark>lncRNAs</mark>) play critical roles during tumorigenesis by functioning as scaffolds that regulate protein-protein, protein-DNA or protein-RNA interactions.
Using a clinically guided genetic screening approach, we identified <mark>lncRNA in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway 1</mark> (<mark>LINP1</mark>), which is overexpressed in human triple-negative breast cancer.
We found that <mark>LINP1</mark> enhances repair of DNA double-strand breaks by serving as a scaffold linking <mark>Ku80</mark> and <mark>DNA-PKcs</mark>, thereby coordinating the NHEJ pathway.
Importantly, blocking <mark>LINP1</mark>, which is regulated by <mark>p53</mark> and <mark>epidermal growth factor receptor</mark> (<mark>EGFR</mark>) signaling, increases the sensitivity of the tumor-cell response to radiotherapy in breast cancer.
The leaves of Diospyros kaki exert beneficial effects on a benzalkonium chloride-induced murine dry eye model.
PURPOSE: In this study, the beneficial effects of the oral administration of ethanol extract of Diospyros kaki (EEDK) were tested on a mouse dry eye model induced by benzalkonium chloride (BAC).
METHODS: A solution of 0.2% BAC was administered topically to mouse eyes for 14 days, twice daily, to induce dry eye.
Various concentrations of EEDK were administrated daily by oral gavage for 14 days after BAC treatment.
Preservative-free eye drops were instilled in the positive-control group.
The tear secretion volume (Schirmer's test), tear break-up time (BUT), and fluorescein score were measured on the ocular surface.
BAC-induced corneal damage was tested with hematoxylin-eosin staining.
Moreover, apoptotic cell death in the corneal epithelial layer was investigated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining.
The protein expression level of <mark>interleukin-1alpha</mark> (<mark>IL-1α</mark>), <mark>IL-1β</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>tumor necrosis factor- alpha</mark> (<mark>TNF-α</mark>), and <mark>monocyte chemotactic protein-1</mark> (<mark>MCP-1</mark>) was determined with western blot analysis.
Furthermore, squamous metaplasia in the corneal epithelial layer was detected with immunofluorescent staining for <mark>cytokeratine-10</mark>.
The cellular proliferation in the cornea was examined with immunohistochemical staining for <mark>Ki-67</mark>.
RESULTS: EEDK treatment resulted in prolonged BUT, decreased fluorescein score, increased tear volume, and smoother epithelial cells compared with BAC treatment alone in the cornea.
Moreover, EEDK treatment inhibited the inflammatory response and corneal epithelial cell death in a BAC-induced murine dry eye model, and changes in squamous cells were inhibited.
Proliferative activity in the corneal epithelium cells was improved with EEDK.
CONCLUSIONS: EEDK could be a potential therapeutic agent in the clinical treatment of dry eye.
Metabolic Symbiosis Enables Adaptive Resistance to Anti-angiogenic Therapy that Is Dependent on <mark>mTOR</mark> Signaling.
Therapeutic targeting of tumor angiogenesis with <mark>VEGF</mark> inhibitors results in demonstrable, but transitory efficacy in certain human tumors and mouse models of cancer, limited by unconventional forms of adaptive/evasive resistance.
In one such mouse model, potent angiogenesis inhibitors elicit compartmental reorganization of cancer cells around remaining blood vessels.
The <mark>glucose and lactate transporters</mark> <mark>GLUT1</mark> and <mark>MCT4</mark> are induced in distal hypoxic cells in a <mark>HIF1α</mark>-dependent fashion, indicative of glycolysis.
Tumor cells proximal to blood vessels instead express the <mark>lactate transporter</mark> <mark>MCT1</mark>, and <mark>p-S6</mar<mark>S6</mark>, the latter reflecting <mark>mTOR</mark> signaling.
Normoxic cancer cells import and metabolize lactate, resulting in upregulation of <mark>mTOR</mark> signaling via glutamine metabolism enhanced by lactate catabolism.
Thus, metabolic symbiosis is established in the face of angiogenesis inhibition, whereby hypoxic cancer cells import glucose and export lactate, while normoxic cells import and catabolize lactate.
<mark>mTOR</mark> signaling inhibition disrupts this metabolic symbiosis, associated with upregulation of the <mark>glucose transporter</mark> <mark>GLUT2</mark>.
Progesterone-Dependent Induction of <mark>Phospholipase C-Related Catalytically Inactive Protein 1</mark> (<mark>PRIP-1</mark>) in Decidualizing Human Endometrial Stromal Cells.
Decidualization denotes the transformation of endometrial stromal cells into specialized decidual cells.
In pregnancy, decidual cells form a protective matrix around the implanting embryo, enabling coordinated trophoblast invasion and formation of a functional placenta.
Continuous progesterone (P4) signaling renders decidual cells resistant to various environmental stressors, whereas withdrawal inevitably triggers tissue breakdown and menstruation or miscarriage.
Here, we show that <mark>PLCL1</mark>, coding <mark>phospholipase C (PLC)-related catalytically inactive protein 1</mark> (<mark>PRIP-1</mark>), is highly induced in response to P4 signaling in decidualizing human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs).
Knockdown experiments in undifferentiated HESCs revealed that <mark>PRIP-1</mark> maintains basal <mark>phosphoinositide 3-kinase</mark>/<mark>Protein kinase B</mark> activity, which in turn prevents illicit nuclear translocation of the transcription factor <mark>forkhead box protein O1</mark> and induction of the apoptotic activator <mark>BIM</mark>.
By contrast, loss of this scaffold protein did not compromise survival of decidual cells.
<mark>PRIP-1</mark> knockdown did also not interfere with the responsiveness of HESCs to deciduogenic cues, although the overall expression of differentiation markers, such as PRL, <mark>IGFBP1</mark>, and <mark>WNT4</mark>, was blunted.
Finally, we show that <mark>PRIP-1</mark> in decidual cells uncouples <mark>PLC</mark> activation from intracellular Ca(2+) release by attenuating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate signaling.
In summary, <mark>PRIP-1</mark> is a multifaceted P4-inducible scaffold protein that gates the activity of major signal transduction pathways in the endometrium.
It prevents apoptosis of proliferating stromal cells and contributes to the relative autonomy of decidual cells by silencing <mark>PLC</mark> signaling downstream of <mark>Gq protein-coupled receptors</mark>.
Cisplatin induces tolerogenic dendritic cells in response to <mark>TLR</mark> agonists via the abundant production of <mark>IL-10</mark>, thereby promoting Th2- and Tr1-biased T-cell immunity.
Although many advantageous roles of cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II), CDDP) have been reported in cancer therapy, the immunomodulatory roles of cisplatin in the phenotypic and functional alterations of dendritic cells (DCs) are poorly understood.
Here, we investigated the effect of cisplatin on the functionality of DCs and the changes in signaling pathways activated upon <mark>toll-like receptor</mark> (<mark>TLR</mark>) stimulation.
Cisplatin-treated DCs down-regulated the expression of cell surface molecules (<mark>CD80</mark>, <mark>CD86</mark>, <mark>MHC class I and II</mark>) and up-regulated endocytic capacity in a dose-dependent manner.
Upon stimulation with various <mark>TLR</mark> agonists, cisplatin-treated DCs showed markedly increased <mark>IL-10</mark> production through activation of the <mark>p38 MAPK</mark> and <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> signaling pathways without altering the levels of <mark>TNF-alpha</mark> and <mark>IL-12p70</mark>, indicating the cisplatin-mediated induction of tolerogenic DCs.
This effect was dependent on the production of <mark>IL-10</mark> from DCs, as neither DCs isolated from <mark>IL-10</mark>-/- mice nor <mark>IL-10</mark>-neutralized DCs generated tolerogenic DCs.
Interestingly, DCs that were co-treated with cisplatin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exhibited a decreased immunostimulatory capacity for inducing the proliferation of Th1- and Th17-type T cells; instead, these DCs contributed to Th2-type T cell immunity.
Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo investigations revealed a unique T cell population, <mark>IL-10</mark>-producing <mark>CD3</mark>+<mark>CD4</mark>+<mark>LAG-3</mark>+<mark>CD49b</mark>+<mark>CD25</mark>-<mark>Foxp3</mark>- Tr1 cells, that was significantly increased without altering the <mark>Foxp3</mark>+ regulatory T cell population.
Taken together, our results suggest that cisplatin induces immune-suppressive tolerogenic DCs in <mark>TLR</mark> agonist-induced inflammatory conditions via abundant <mark>IL-10</mark> production, thereby skewing Th cell differentiation towards Th2 and Tr1 cells.
This relationship may provide cancer cells with an opportunity to evade the immune system.
Medial <mark>HOXA</mark> genes demarcate haematopoietic stem cell fate during human development.
Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) may provide a potential source of haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) for transplantation; however, unknown molecular barriers prevent the self-renewal of PSC-HSPCs.
Using two-step differentiation, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) differentiated in vitro into multipotent haematopoietic cells that had the <mark>CD34</mark>(+)<mark>CD38</mark>(-/lo)<mark>CD90</mark>(+)<mark>CD45</mark>(+)<mark>GPI-80</mark>(+) fetal liver (FL) HSPC immunophenotype, but exhibited poor expansion potential and engraftment ability.
Transcriptome analysis of immunophenotypic hESC-HSPCs revealed that, despite their molecular resemblance to FL-HSPCs, medial <mark>HOXA</mark> genes remained suppressed.
Knockdown of <mark>HOXA7</mark> disrupted FL-HSPC function and caused transcriptome dysregulation that resembled hESC-derived progenitors.
Overexpression of medial <mark>HOXA</mark> genes prolonged FL-HSPC maintenance but was insufficient to confer self-renewal to hESC-HSPCs.
Stimulation of retinoic acid signalling during endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition induced the <mark>HOXA</mark> cluster and other <mark>HSC</mark>/definitive haemogenic endothelium genes, and prolonged HSPC maintenance in culture.
Thus, medial <mark>HOXA</mark> gene expression induced by retinoic acid signalling marks the establishment of the definitive HSPC fate and controls HSPC identity and function.
<mark>Calreticulin</mark>-mutant proteins induce megakaryocytic signaling to transform hematopoietic cells and undergo accelerated degradation and Golgi-mediated secretion.
BACKGROUND: Somatic <mark>calreticulin</mark> (<mark>CALR</mark>), <mark>Janus kinase 2</mark> (<mark>JAK2</mark>), and <mark>thrombopoietin receptor</mark> (<mark>MPL</mark>) mutations essentially show mutual exclusion in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), suggesting that they activate common oncogenic pathways.
Recent data have shown that <mark>MPL</mark> function is essential for <mark>CALR</mark> mutant-driven MPN.
However, the exact role and the mechanisms of action of <mark>CALR</mark> mutants have not been fully elucidated.
METHODS: The murine myeloid cell line 32D and human HL60 cells overexpressing the most frequent <mark>CALR</mark> type 1 and type 2 frameshift mutants were generated to analyze the first steps of cellular transformation, in the presence and absence of <mark>MPL</mark> expression.
Furthermore, mutant <mark>CALR</mark> protein stability and secretion were examined using brefeldin A, MG132, spautin-1, and tunicamycin treatment.
RESULTS: The present study demonstrates that the expression of endogenous <mark>Mpl</mark>, <mark>CD41</mark>, and the key megakaryocytic transcription factor <mark>NF-E2</mark> is stimulated by type 1 and type 2 <mark>CALR</mark> mutants, even in the absence of exogenous <mark>MPL</mark>.
Mutant <mark>CALR</mark> expressing 32D cells spontaneously acquired cytokine independence, and this was associated with increased <mark>Mpl</mark> mRNA expression, <mark>CD41</mark>, and <mark>NF-E2</mark> protein as well as constitutive activation of downstream signaling and response to <mark>JAK</mark> inhibitor treatment.
Exogenous expression of <mark>MPL</mark> led to constitutive activation of <mark>STAT3 and 5</mark>, <mark>ERK1/2</mark>, and <mark>AKT</mark>, cytokine-independent growth, and reduction of apoptosis similar to the effects seen in the spontaneously outgrown cells.
We observed low <mark>CALR</mark>-mutant protein amounts in cellular lysates of stably transduced cells, and this was due to accelerated protein degradation that occurred independently from the ubiquitin-proteasome system as well as autophagy.
<mark>CALR</mark>-mutant degradation was attenuated by <mark>MPL</mark> expression.
Interestingly, we found high levels of mutated <mark>CALR</mark> and loss of downstream signaling after blockage of the secretory pathway and protein glycosylation.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the potency of <mark>CALR</mark> mutants to drive expression of megakaryocytic differentiation markers such as <mark>NF-E2</mark> and <mark>CD41</mark> as well as <mark>Mpl</mark>.
Furthermore, <mark>CALR</mark> mutants undergo accelerated protein degradation that involves the secretory pathway and/or protein glycosylation.
<mark>Metallothionein-1</mark> as a biomarker of altered redox metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma cells exposed to sorafenib.
BACKGROUND: Sorafenib, a kinase inhibitor active against various solid tumours, induces oxidative stress and ferroptosis, a new form of oxidative necrosis, in some cancer cells.
Clinically-applicable biomarkers that reflect the impact of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells are lacking.
METHODS: We used gene expression microarrays, real-time PCR, immunoblot, protein-specific ELISA, and gene reporter constructs encoding the enzyme luciferase to study the response of a panel of cancer cells to sorafenib.
Tumour explants prepared from surgical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples and serum samples obtained from HCC patients receiving sorafenib were also used.
RESULTS: We observed that genes of the <mark>metallothionein-1</mark> (<mark>MT1</mark>) family are induced in the HCC cell line <mark>Huh7</mark> exposed to sorafenib.
Sorafenib increased the expression of <mark>MT1G</mark> mRNA in a panel of human cancer cells, an effect that was not observed with eight other clinically-approved kinase inhibitors.
We identified the minimal region of the <mark>MT1G</mark> promoter that confers inducibility by sorafenib to a 133 base pair region containing an Anti-oxidant Response Element (ARE) and showed the essential role of the transcription factor <mark>NRF2</mark> (<mark>Nuclear factor erythroid 2-Related Factor 2</mark>).
We examined the clinical relevance of our findings by analysing the regulation of <mark>MT1G</mark> in five tumour explants prepared from surgical HCC samples.
Finally, we showed that the protein levels of <mark>MT1</mark> increase in the serum of some HCC patients receiving sorafenib, and found an association with reduced overall survival.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that <mark>MT1</mark> constitute a biomarker adapted for exploring the impact of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells.
Prognostic factors in the myoepithelial-like spindle cell type of metaplastic breast cancer.
Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) comprises a heterogeneous group of tumors with difficult to predict biological behavior.
A subset of MBC, characterized by spindle-shaped tumor cells with a myoepithelial-like immunophenotype, was entered into a retrospective study (n = 42, median follow-up time 43 months).
Molecular parameters (DNA sequences of mutation hot spots in <mark>AKT1</mark>, <mark>ALK</mark>, <mark>APC</mark>, <mark>BRAF</mark>, <mark>CDH1</mark>, <mark>CTNNB1</mark>, <mark>EGFR</mark>, <mark>ERBB2</mark>, <mark>FBXW7</mark>, <mark>FGFR2</mark>, <mark>FOXL2</mark>, <mark>GNAQ</mark>, <mark>GNAS</mark>, <mark>KIT</mark>, <mark>KRAS</mark>, <mark>MAP2K1</mark>, <mark>MET</mark>, <mark>MSH6</mark>, <mark>NRAS</mark>, <mark>PDGFRA</mark>, <mark>PIK3CA</mark>, <mark>PTEN</mark>, <mark>SF3B1</mark>, <mark>SMAD4</mark>, <mark>SRC</mark>, <mark>SRSF2</mark>, <mark>STK11</mark>, <mark>TP53</mark>, and <mark>U2AF1</mark>; copy numbers for <mark>EGFR</mark>, <mark>c-myc</mark>, <mark>FGFR</mark>, <mark>PLAG</mark>, <mark>c-met</mark>) were assessed.
None of the patients had axillary lymph node involvement.
In 13 cases, local recurrence developed after surgery (30.9 %).
Distant metastasis occurred in seven patients (17 %; four after local recurrence).
The most frequent genetic alteration was <mark>PIK3CA</mark> mutation (50 % of cases).
None of the pathological parameters (size, grade, stage, <mark>Ki-67</mark> labeling index) was significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS).
<mark>PIK3CA</mark> mutation, especially the H1047R type, tended to adversely affect OS.
Type of resection (mastectomy vs. breast-conserving therapy, width of margins) or adjuvant radiotherapy had no influence on DFS or OS, whereas in the group treated with radio-/chemotherapy, no local recurrence or metastasis and no death occurred.
We conclude that the spindle cell type of MBC with myoepithelial features exhibits a higher frequency of <mark>PIK3CA</mark> mutation than other types of metaplastic or basal-like breast cancer and may benefit from combined radio-/chemotherapy.
Classical pathological parameters are not helpful in identifying the high-risk tumors among this subgroup of MBC.
Telomere Replication Stress Induced by <mark>POT1</mark> Inactivation Accelerates Tumorigenesis.
Genome sequencing studies have revealed a number of cancer-associated mutations in the telomere-binding factor <mark>POT1</mark>.
Here, we show that when combined with <mark>p53</mark> deficiency, depletion of murine <mark>POT1a</mark> in common lymphoid progenitor cells fosters genetic instability, accelerates the onset, and increases the severity of T cell lymphomas.
In parallel, we examined human and mouse cells carrying <mark>POT1</mark> mutations found in cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) patients.
Inhibition of <mark>POT1</mark> activates <mark>ATR</mark>-dependent DNA damage signaling and induces telomere fragility, replication fork stalling, and telomere elongation.
Our data suggest that these phenotypes are linked to impaired <mark>CST</mark> (<mark>CTC1</mark>-<mark>STN1</mark>-<mark>TEN1</mark>) function at telomeres.
Lastly, we show that proliferation of cancer cells lacking <mark>POT1</mark> is enabled by the attenuation of the <mark>ATR</ma<mark>ATR kinase</mark> pathway.
These results uncover a role for defective telomere replication during tumorigenesis.
Rh<mark>BMP-2</mark> Activates Hippo Signaling through <mark>RASSF1</mark> in Esophageal Cancer Cells.
Despite that recombinant human <mark>bone morphogenetic protein-2</mark> (rh<mark>BMP-2</mark>) has been reported as a stimulatory effecter of cancer cell growth because of its characteristic like morphogen, the biological functions of rh<mark>BMP-2</mark> in human esophageal cancer cells are unknown.
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether rh<mark>BMP-2</mark> has an inhibitory effect on the growth of human esophageal squamous carcinoma cells (ESCC).
Rh<mark>BMP-2</mark> significantly inhibited proliferation of ESCC cells in a dose-dependent manner in the MTT assay.
Cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase was induced 24 h after rh<mark>BMP2</mark> treatment.
Rh<mark>BMP-2</mark> also reduced <mark>cyclin D1</mark>, <mark>cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4</mark> and <mark>CDK 6</mark> activities, and stimulated p-<mark>Smad1/5/8</mark>, <mark>p53</mark>, and <mark>p21</mark> levels at 12 h. In contrast, rh<mark>BMP-2</mark> diminished <mark>poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase</mark> (<mark>PARP</mark>) protein expression levels and activated cleaved <mark>PARP</mark>, cleaved <mark>caspase-7</mark>, and cleaved-<mark>caspase 9</mark> levels in ESCC cells.
In addition, rh<mark>BMP-2</mark> increased <mark>MST1</mark>, <mark>MOB1</mark>, and p-<mark>YAP</mark> protein levels and the <mark>RASSF1</mark> binds <mark>Mst1</mark> more upon treatment with rh<mark>BMP2</mark>.
The induced p-<mark>YAP</mark> expression in TE-8 and TE-12 cells by rh<mark>BMP-2</mark> was reversed by the <mark>RASSF1</mark> knockdown.
In vivo study, rh<mark>BMP-2</mark> decreased tumor volume following subcutaneous implantation and showed higher radiologic score (less bony destruction) after femoral implantation compared to those in a control group.
These results suggest that rh<mark>BMP-2</mark> inhibits rather than activates proliferation of human esophageal cancer cells which is mediated through activating the hippo signaling pathway.
<mark>E2F</mark> and <mark>GATA</mark> switches turn off <mark>WD repeat domain 77</mark> expression in differentiating cells.
<mark>WDR77</mark> (<mark>WD repeat domain 77</mark>) is expressed during earlier lung development when cells are rapidly proliferating, but is absent from adult lung.
It is re-activated during lung tumorigenesis and is essential for lung cancer cell proliferation.
Signalling pathways/molecules that control <mark>WDR77</mark> gene expression are unknown.
Promoter mapping, gel shift assay and ChIP revealed that the <mark>WDR77</mark> promoter contains bona fide response elements for <mark>E2F</mark> and <mark>GATA</mark> transcriptional factors as demonstrated in prostate cancer, lung cancer and erythroid cells, as well as in mouse lung tissues.
The <mark>WDR77</mark> promoter is transactivated by <mark>E2F1</mark>, <mark>E2F3</mark>, <mark>GATA1</mark> and <mark>GATA6</mark>, but suppressed by <mark>E2F6</mark>, <mark>GATA1</mark> and <mark>GATA3</mark> in prostate cancer PC3 cells.
<mark>WDR77</mark> expression is associated with <mark>E2F1</mark>, <mark>E2F3</mark>, <mark>GATA2</mark> and <mark>GATA6</mark> occupancy on the <mark>WDR77</mark> gene, whereas, in contrast, <mark>E2F6</mark>, <mark>GATA1</mark> and <mark>GATA3</mark> occupancy is associated with the loss of <mark>WDR77</mark> expression during erythroid maturation and lung development.
More importantly, the loss of <mark>WDR77</mark> expression that results from <mark>E2F</mark> and <mark>GATA</mark> switches is required for cellular differentiation of erythroid and lung epithelial cells.
In contrast, lung cancer cells avoid post-mitotic differentiation by sustaining <mark>WDR77</mark> expression.
Altogether, the present study provides a novel molecular mechanism by which <mark>WDR77</mark> is regulated during erythroid and lung development and lung tumorigenesis.
Loss of the <mark>Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase</mark> <mark>PTPN22</mark> Reduces Mannan-Induced Autoimmune Arthritis in SKG Mice.
The cytoplasmic phosphatase, <mark>protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22</mark> (<mark>PTPN22</mark>), is a negative regulator of T cell signaling.
Genome-wide association studies have shown that single-nucleotide polymorphisms in <mark>PTPN22</mark> confer an increased risk of developing multiple autoimmune diseases in humans.
The precise function of <mark>PTPN22</mark> and how the variant protein contributes to autoimmunity is not well understood.
To address this issue, we investigated the effect of <mark>PTPN22</mark> deficiency on disease susceptibility in a mouse model of autoimmune arthritis.
The SKG mouse expresses a hypomorphic mutant allele of <mark>ZAP70</mark>, which, upon exposure to fungal Ags, predisposes the mice to a <mark>CD4</mark>(+) T cell-mediated autoimmune arthritis that closely resembles rheumatoid arthritis in humans.
Surprisingly, SKG <mark>Ptpn22</mark>(-/-) mice developed less severe mannan-induced arthritis compared with SKG mice.
Diminution of disease was not due to significant alterations in thymocyte development or repertoire selection in SKG <mark>Ptpn22</mark>(-/-) mice, even though T cell-mediated signal transduction was improved.
Instead, <mark>Ptpn22</mark> deficiency appeared to bias <mark>CD4</mark> Th cell differentiation away from the Th17 lineage, which is pathogenic in this setting, to a more Th1/T regulatory-focused response.
These data show that even small perturbations in TCR signal transduction pathways can have profound consequences on the differentiation of T cell lineages and thus for the development of autoimmune diseases.
<mark>T-bet</mark> Activates Th1 Genes through <mark>Mediator</mark> and the <mark>Super Elongation Complex</mark>.
The transcription factor <mark>T-bet</mark> directs Th1 cell differentiation, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie this lineage-specific gene regulation are not completely understood.
Here, we show that <mark>T-bet</mark> acts through enhancers to allow the recruitment of <mark>Mediator</mark> and <mark>P-TEFb</mark> in the form of the <mark>super e<mark>super elongation complex (SEC)</m<mark>SEC</mark>>.
Th1 genes are occupied by <mark>H3</mark>K4me3 and <mark>RNA polymerase II</mark> in Th2 cells, while <mark>T-bet</mark>-mediated recruitment of <mark>P-TEFb</mark> in Th1 cells activates transcriptional elongation.
<mark>P-TEFb</mark> is recruited to both genes and enhancers, where it activates enhancer RNA transcription.
<mark>P-TEFb</mark> inhibition and <mark>Mediator</mark> and <mark>SEC</mark> knockdown selectively block activation of <mark>T-bet</mark> target genes, and <mark>P-TEFb</mark> inhibition abrogates Th1-associated experimental autoimmune uveitis.
<mark>T-bet</mark> activity is independent of changes in <mark>NF-κB RelA</mark> and <mark>Brd4</mark> binding, with <mark>T-bet</mark>- and <mark>NF-κB</mark>-mediated pathways instead converging to allow <mark>P-TEFb</mark> recruitment.
These data provide insight into the mechanism through which lineage-specifying factors promote differentiation of alternative T cell fates.
Investigating core genetic-and-epigenetic cell cycle networks for stemness and carcinogenic mechanisms, and cancer drug design using big database mining and genome-wide next-generation sequencing data.
Recent studies have demonstrated that cell cycle plays a central role in development and carcinogenesis.
Thus, the use of big databases and genome-wide high-throughput data to unravel the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying cell cycle progression in stem cells and cancer cells is a matter of considerable interest.
Real genetic-and-epigenetic cell cycle networks (GECNs) of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and HeLa cancer cells were constructed by applying system modeling, system identification, and big database mining to genome-wide next-generation sequencing data.
Real GECNs were then reduced to core GECNs of HeLa cells and ESCs by applying principal genome-wide network projection.
In this study, we investigated potential carcinogenic and stemness mechanisms for systems cancer drug design by identifying common core and specific GECNs between HeLa cells and ESCs.
Integrating drug database information with the specific GECNs of HeLa cells could lead to identification of multiple drugs for cervical cancer treatment with minimal side-effects on the genes in the common core.
We found that dysregulation of <mark>miR-29C</mark>, <mark>miR-34A</mark>, <mark>miR-98</mark>, and <mark>miR-215</mark>; and methylation of <mark>ANKRD1</mark>, <mark>ARID5B</mark>, <mark>CDCA2</mark>, <mark>PIF1</mark>, <mark>STAMBPL1</mark>, <mark>TROAP</mark>, <mark>ZNF165</mark>, and <mark>HIST1H2AJ</mark> in HeLa cells could result in cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis through <mark>NFκB</mark>, <mark>TGF-β</mark>, and <mark>PI3K</mark> pathways.
We also identified 3 drugs, methotrexate, quercetin, and mimosine, which repressed the activated cell cycle genes, <mark>ARID5B</mark>, <mark>STK17B</mark>, and <mark>CCL2</mark>, in HeLa cells with minimal side-effects.
A recurrent p.Arg92Trp variant in <mark>steroidogenic factor-1</mark> (<mark>NR5A1</mark>) can act as a molecular switch in human sex development.
Cell lineages of the early human gonad commit to one of the two mutually antagonistic organogenetic fates, the testis or the ovary.
Some individuals with a 46,XX karyotype develop testes or ovotestes (testicular or ovotesticular disorder of sex development; TDSD/OTDSD), due to the presence of the testis-determining gene, <mark>SRY</mark> Other rare complex syndromic forms of TDSD/OTDSD are associated with mutations in pro-ovarian genes that repress testis development (e.g. <mark>WNT4</mark>); however, the genetic cause of the more common non-syndromic forms is unknown.
<mark>Steroidogenic factor-1</mark> (known as <mark>NR5A1</mark>) is a key regulator of reproductive development and function.
Loss-of-function changes in <mark>NR5A1</mark> in 46,XY individuals are associated with a spectrum of phenotypes in humans ranging from a lack of testis formation to male infertility.
Mutations in <mark>NR5A1</mark> in 46,XX women are associated with primary ovarian insufficiency, which includes a lack of ovary formation, primary and secondary amenorrhoea as well as early menopause.
Here, we show that a specific recurrent heterozygous missense mutation (p.Arg92Trp) in the accessory DNA-binding region of <mark>NR5A1</mark> is associated with variable degree of testis development in 46,XX children and adults from four unrelated families.
Remarkably, in one family a sibling raised as a girl and carrying this <mark>NR5A1</mark> mutation was found to have a 46,XY karyotype with partial testicular dysgenesis.
These unique findings highlight how a specific variant in a developmental transcription factor can switch organ fate from the ovary to testis in mammals and represents the first missense mutation causing isolated, non-syndromic 46,XX testicular/ovotesticular DSD in humans.
Male <mark>11β-HSD1</mark> Knockout Mice Fed Trans-Fats and Fructose Are Not Protected From Metabolic Syndrome or Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) defines a spectrum of conditions from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis and is regarded as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome.
Glucocorticoids can promote steatosis by stimulating lipolysis within adipose tissue, free fatty acid delivery to liver and hepatic de novo lipogenesis.
Glucocorticoids can be reactivated in liver through <mark>11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1</mark> (<mark>11β-HSD1</mark>) enzyme activity.
Inhibition of <mark>11β-HSD1</mark> has been suggested as a potential treatment for NAFLD.
To test this, male mice with global (<mark>11β-HSD1</mark> knockout [KO]) and liver-specific (LKO) <mark>11β-HSD1</mark> loss of function were fed the American Lifestyle Induced Obesity Syndrome (ALIOS) diet, known to recapitulate the spectrum of NAFLD, and metabolic and liver phenotypes assessed.
Body weight, muscle and adipose tissue masses, and parameters of glucose homeostasis showed that <mark>11β-HSD1</mark>KO and LKO mice were not protected from systemic metabolic disease.
Evaluation of hepatic histology, triglyceride content, and blinded NAFLD activity score assessment indicated that levels of steatosis were similar between <mark>11β-HSD1</mark>KO, LKO, and control mice.
Unexpectedly, histological analysis revealed significantly increased levels of immune foci present in livers of <mark>11β-HSD1</mark>KO but not LKO or control mice, suggestive of a transition to NASH.
This was endorsed by elevated hepatic expression of key immune cell and inflammatory markers.
These data indicate that <mark>11β-HSD1</mark>-deficient mice are not protected from metabolic disease or hepatosteatosis in the face of a NAFLD-inducing diet.
However, global deficiency of <mark>11β-HSD1</mark> did increase markers of hepatic inflammation and suggests a critical role for <mark>11β-HSD1</mark> in restraining the transition to NASH.
A Critical Role for <mark>CD200R</mark> Signaling in Limiting the Growth and Metastasis of <mark>CD200</mark>+ Melanoma.
<mark>CD200</mark> is a cell surface glycoprotein that functions through engaging <mark>CD200R</mark> on cells of the myeloid lineage and inhibits their functions.
Expression of <mark>CD200</mark> was implicated in a variety of human cancer cells, including melanoma cells; however, its roles in tumor growth and immunity are not clearly understood.
In this study, we used <mark>CD200R</mark>-deficient mice and the <mark>B16 tumor</mark> model to evaluate this issue.
We found that <mark>CD200R</mark>-deficient mice exhibited accelerated growth of <mark>CD200</mark>(+), but not <mark>CD200</mark>(-), B16 tumors.
Strikingly, <mark>CD200R</mark>-deficient mice receiving <mark>CD200</mark>(+) B16 cells i.v. exhibited massive tumor growth in multiple organs, including liver, lung, kidney, and peritoneal cavity, whereas the growth of the same tumors in wild-type mice was limited.
<mark>CD200</mark>(+) tumors grown in <mark>CD200R</mark>-deficient mice contained higher numbers of <mark>CD11b</mark>(+)<mark>Ly6C</mark>(+) myeloid cells, exhibited increased expression of <mark>VEGF</mark> and <mark>HIF1α</mark> genes with increased angiogenesis, and showed significantly reduced infiltration of <mark>CD4</mark>(+) and <mark>CD8</mark>(+) T cells, presumably as the result of reduced expression of T cell <mark>chemokines</mark>, such as <mark>CXCL9</mark> and <mark>CXCL16</mark>.
The liver from <mark>CD200R</mark>-deficient mice, under metastatic growth of <mark>CD200</mark>(+) tumors, contained significantly increased numbers of <mark>CD11b</mark>(+)<mark>Gr1</mark>(-) myeloid cells and <mark>Foxp3</mark>(+) regulatory T cells and reduced numbers of NK cells.
Liver T cells also had a reduced capacity to produce <mark>IFN-γ</mark> or <mark>TNF-α</mark>.
Taken together, we revealed a critical role for <mark>CD200R</mark> signaling in limiting the growth and metastasis of <mark>CD200</mark>(+) tumors.
Thus, targeting <mark>CD200R</mark> signaling may potentially interfere with the metastatic growth of <mark>CD200</mark>(+) tumors, like melanoma.
<mark>Adrenomedullin</mark> promotes the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma through recruitment of myelomonocytic cells.
Stromal infiltration of myelomonocytic cells is a hallmark of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and is related to a poor prognosis.
However, the detailed mechanism for the recruitment of myelomonocytic cells to pancreatic cancer tissue remains unclear.
In the present study, pancreatic cancer cells secreted high levels of <mark>adrenomedullin</mark> (<mark>ADM</mark>), and <mark>CD11b</mark>+ myelomonocytic cells expressed all components of <mark>ADM receptors</mark>, including <mark>GPR182</mark>, <mark>CRLR</mark>, <mark>RAMP2</mark> and <mark>RAMP3</mark>.
<mark>ADM</mark> enhanced the migration and invasion of myelomonocytic cells through activation of the <mark>MAPK</mark>, <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> and <mark>eNOS</mark> signaling pathways, as well as the expression and activity of <mark>MMP-2</mark>.
<mark>ADM</mark> also promoted the adhesion and trans-endothelial migration of myelomonocytic cells by increasing expression of <mark>VCAM-1</mark> and <mark>ICAM-1</mark> in endothelial cells.
In addition, <mark>ADM</mark> induced macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to express pro-tumor phenotypes.
<mark>ADM</mark> knockdown in tumor-bearing mice or administration of AMA, an <mark>ADM</mark> antagonist, significantly inhibited the recruitment of myelomonocytic cells and tumor angiogenesis.
Moreover, in vivo depletion of myelomonocytic cells using clodronate liposomes suppressed the progression of PDAC.
These results reveal a novel function of <mark>ADM</mark> in PDAC, and suggest <mark>ADM</mark> is a promising target in the treatment of PDAC.
<mark>VHL</mark>-deficient renal cancer cells gain resistance to mitochondria-activating apoptosis inducers by activating <mark>AKT</mark> through the <mark>IGF1R</mark>-<mark>PI3K</mark> pathway.
We previously developed (2-deoxyglucose)-(ABT-263) combination therapy (2DG-ABT), which induces apoptosis by activating <mark>Bak</mark> in the mitochondria of highly glycolytic cells with varied genetic backgrounds.
However, the rates of apoptosis induced by 2DG-ABT were lower in <mark>von Hippel-Lindau</mark> (<mark>VHL</mark>)-deficient cancer cells.
The re-expression of <mark>VHL</mark> protein in these cells lowered <mark>IGF1R</mark> expression in a manner independent of oxygen concentration.
Lowering <mark>IGF1R</mark> expression via small interfering RNA (siRNA) sensitized the cells to 2DG-ABT, suggesting that <mark>IGF1R</mark> interfered with the activation of apoptosis by the mitochondria.
To determine which of the two pathways activated by <mark>IGF1R</mark>, the <mark>Ras</mark>-<mark>ERK</mark> pathway or the <mark>PI3K</mark>-<mark>AKT</mark> pathway, was involved in the impairment of mitochondria activation, the cells were treated with a specific inhibitor of either <mark>PI3K</mark> or <mark>ERK</mark>, and 2DG-ABT was added to activate the mitochondria.
The apoptotic rates resulting from 2DG-ABT treatment were higher in the cells treated with the <mark>PI3K</mark> inhibitor, while the rates remained approximately the same in the cells treated with the <mark>ERK</mark> inhibitor.
In 2DG-ABT-sensitive cells, a 4-h 2DG treatment caused the dissociation of <mark>Mcl-1</mark> from <mark>Bak</mark>, while ABT treatment alone caused the dissociation of <mark>Bcl-xL</mark> from <mark>Bak</mark> without substantially reducing <mark>Mcl-1</mark> levels.
In 2DG-ABT-resistant cells, <mark>Mcl-1</mark> dissociated from <mark>Bak</mark> only when <mark>AKT</mark> activity was inhibited during the 4-h 2DG treatment.
Thus, in <mark>VHL</mark>-deficient cells, <mark>IGF1R</mark> activated <mark>AKT</mark> and stabilized the <mark>Bak</mark>-<mark>Mcl-1</mark> complex, thereby conferring cell resistance to apoptosis.
Decreased Whole-Body Fat Mass Produced by Chronic Alcohol Consumption is Associated with Activation of <mark>S6K1</mark>-Mediated Protein Synthesis and Increased Autophagy in Epididymal White Adipose Tissue.
BACKGROUND: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to a loss of white adipose tissue (WAT) but the underlying mechanisms for this lipodystrophy are not fully elucidated.
This study tested the hypothesis that the reduction in WAT mass in chronic alcohol-fed mice is associated with a decreased protein synthesis specifically related to impaired function of <mark>mammalian target of rapamycin</mark> (<mark>mTOR</mark>).
METHODS: Adult male mice were provided an alcohol-containing liquid diet for 24 weeks or an isonitrogenous isocaloric control diet.
In vivo protein synthesis was determined at this time and thereafter epididymal WAT (eWAT) was excised for analysis of signal transduction pathways central to controling protein synthesis and degradation.
RESULTS: While chronic alcohol feeding decreased whole-body and eWAT mass, this was associated with a discordant increase in protein synthesis in eWAT.
This increase was not associated with a change in <mark>mTOR</mark>, <mark>4E-BP1</mark>, <mark>Akt</mark>, or <mark>PRAS40</mark> phosphorylation.
Instead, a selective increase in phosphorylation of <mark>S6K1</mark> and its downstream substrates, <mark>S6</mark> and <mark>eIF4B</mark> was detected in alcohol-fed mice.
Alcohol also increased <mark>eEF2K</mark> phosphorylation and decreased <mark>eEF2</mark> phosphorylation consistent with increased translation elongation.
Alcohol increased <mark>Atg12-5</mark>, <mark>LC3B</mark>-I and -II, and <mark>ULK1</mark> S555 phosphorylation, suggesting increased autophagy, while markers of apoptosis (cleaved <mark>caspase-3 and -9</mark>, and <mark>PARP</mark>) were unchanged.
Lipolytic enzymes (<mark>ATGL</mark> and <mark>HSL</mark> phosphorylation) were increased and lipogenic regulators (<mark>PPARgamma</mark> and <mark>C/EBPalpha</mark>) were decreased in eWAT by alcohol.
Although alcohol increased <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, and <mark>IL-1beta</mark> mRNA, no change in key components of the <mark>NLRP3</mark> inflammasome (<mark>NLRP3</mark>, <mark>ACS</mark>, and cleaved <mark>caspase-1</mark>) was detected suggesting alcohol did not increase pyroptosis.
Plasma <mark>insulin</mark> did not differ between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the alcohol-induced decrease in whole-body fat mass resulted in part from activation of autophagy in eWAT as protein synthesis was increased and mediated by the specific increase in the activity of <mark>S6K1</mark>.
<mark>Proteinase-activated receptor 2</mark> (<mark>PAR2</mark>) in hepatic stellate cells - evidence for a role in hepatocellular carcinoma growth in vivo.
BACKGROUND: Previous studies have established that <mark>proteinase-activated receptor 2</mark> (<mark>PAR2</mark>) promotes migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, suggesting a role in HCC progression.
Here, we assessed the impact of <mark>PAR2</mark> in HCC stromal cells on HCC growth using LX-2 hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and Hep3B cells as model.
METHODS: <mark>PAR2</mark> expression and function in LX-2 cells was analysed by RT-PCR, confocal immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and [Ca(2+)]i measurements, respectively.
The impact of LX-2-expressed <mark>PAR2</mark> on tumour growth in vivo was monitored using HCC xenotransplantation experiments in SCID mice, in which HCC-like tumours were induced by coinjection of LX-2 cells and Hep3B cells.
To characterise the effects of <mark>PAR2</mark> activation in LX-2 cells, various signalling pathways were analysed by immunoblotting and proteome profiler arrays.
RESULTS: Following verification of functional <mark>PAR2</mark> expression in LX-2 cells, in vivo studies showed that these cells promoted tumour growth and angiogenesis of HCC xenografts in mice.
These effects were significantly reduced when <mark>F2RL1</mark> (encoding <mark>PAR2</mark>) was downregulated by RNA interference (RNAi).
In vitro studies confirmed these results demonstrating RNAi mediated inhibition of <mark>PAR2</mark> attenuated <mark>Smad2/3</mark> activation in response to <mark>TGF-b1</mark> stimulation in LX-2 cells and blocked the pro-mitotic effect of LX-2 derived conditioned medium on Hep3B cells.
Furthermore, <mark>PAR2</mark> stimulation with trypsin or a <mark>PAR2</mark>-selective activating peptide (<mark>PAR2</mark>-AP) led to activation of different intracellular signalling pathways, an increased secretion of pro-angiogenic and pro-mitotic factors and <mark>proteinases</mark>, and an enhanced migration rate across a <mark>collagen</mark>-coated membrane barrier.
Silencing <mark>F2RL1</mark> by RNAi or pharmacological inhibition of <mark>Src</mark>, <mark>hepatocyte growth factor receptor</mark> (<mark>Met</mark>), <mark>platelet-derived growth factor receptor</mark> (<mark>PDGFR</mark>), <mark>p42/p44 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)</mark> or <mark>matrix-metalloproteinases</mark> (<mark>MMPs</mark>) blocked <mark>PAR2</mark>-AP-induced migration.
CONCLUSION: <mark>PAR2</mark> in HSCs plays a crucial role in promoting HCC growth presumably by mediating migration and secretion of pro-angiogenic and pro-mitotic factors.
Therefore, <mark>PAR2</mark> in stromal HSCs may have relevance as a therapeutic target of HCC.
<mark>PD-1</mark>/<mark>PD-L1</mark> Blockade Enhances T-cell Activity and Antitumor Efficacy of Imatinib in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors.
PURPOSE: <mark>Tyrosine kinase</mark> inhibitors are effective in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) but often are of transient benefit as resistance commonly develops.
Immunotherapy, particularly blockade of the inhibitory receptor <mark>programmed death 1</mark> (<mark>PD-1</mark>) or the ligand <mark>programmed death ligand 1</mark> (<mark>PD-L1</mark>), has shown effectiveness in a variety of cancers.
The functional effects of <mark>PD-1</mark>/<mark>PD-L1</mark> blockade are unknown in GISTs.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed tumor and matched blood samples from 85 patients with GISTs and determined the expression of immune checkpoint molecules using flow cytometry.
We investigated the combination of imatinib with <mark>PD-1</mark>/<mark>PD-L1</mark> blockade in <mark>Kit</mark>V558Delta/+ mice that develop GISTs.
RESULTS: The inhibitory receptors <mark>PD-1</mark>, <mark>lymphocyte activation gene 3</mark>, and <mark>T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3</mark> were upregulated on tumor-infiltrating T cells compared with T cells from matched blood.
<mark>PD-1</mark> expression on T cells was highest in imatinib-treated human GISTs.
Meanwhile, intratumoral <mark>PD-L1</mark> expression was variable.
In human GIST cell lines, treatment with imatinib abrogated the <mark>IFNgamma</mark>-induced upregulation of <mark>PD-L1</mark> via <mark>STAT1</mark> inhibition.
In <mark>Kit</mark>V558Delta/+ mice, imatinib downregulated <mark>IFNgamma</mark>-related genes and reduced <mark>PD-L1</mark> expression on tumor cells.
<mark>PD-1</mark> and <mark>PD-L1</mark> blockade in vivo each had no efficacy alone but enhanced the antitumor effects of imatinib by increasing T-cell effector function in the presence of <mark>KIT</mark> and <mark>IDO</mark> inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS: <mark>PD-1</mark>/<mark>PD-L1</mark> blockade is a promising strategy to improve the effects of targeted therapy in GISTs.
Collectively, our results provide the rationale to combine these agents in human GISTs.

<mark>MicroRNA-203</mark> mimics age-related aortic smooth muscle dysfunction of cytoskeletal pathways.
Increased aortic stiffness is a biomarker for subsequent adverse cardiovascular events.
We have previously reported that vascular smooth muscle <mark>Src</mark>-dependent cytoskeletal remodelling, which contributes to aortic plasticity, is impaired with ageing.
Here, we use a multi-scale approach to determine the molecular mechanisms behind defective <mark>Src</mark>-dependent signalling in an aged C57BL/6 male mouse model.
Increased aortic stiffness, as measured in vivo by pulse wave velocity, was found to have a comparable time course to that in humans.
Bioinformatic analyses predicted several miRs to regulate <mark>Src</mark>-dependent cytoskeletal remodelling.
qRT-PCR was used to determine the relative levels of predicted miRs in aortas and, notably, the expression of <mark>miR-203</mark> increased almost twofold in aged aorta.
Increased <mark>miR-203</mark> expression was associated with a decrease in both mRNA and protein expression of <mark>Src</mark>, <mark>caveolin-1</mark> and <mark>paxillin</mark> in aged aorta.
Probing with phospho-specific antibodies confirmed that overexpression of <mark>miR-203</mark> significantly attenuated <mark>Src</mark> and <mark>extracellular signal regulated kinase</mark> (<mark>ERK</mark>) signalling, which we have previously found to regulate vascular smooth muscle stiffness.
In addition, transfection of <mark>miR-203</mark> into aortic tissue from young mice increased phenylephrine-induced aortic stiffness ex vivo, mimicking the aged phenotype.
Upstream of <mark>miR-203</mark>, we found that <mark>DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) 1, 3a, and 3b</mark> are also significantly decreased in the aged mouse aorta and that <mark>DNMT</mark> inhibition significantly increases <mark>miR-203</mark> expression.
Thus, the age-induced increase in <mark>miR-203</mark> may be caused by epigenetic promoter hypomethylation in the aorta.
These findings indicate that <mark>miR-203</mark> promotes a re-programming of <mark>Src</mark>/<mark>ERK</mark> signalling pathways in vascular smooth muscle, impairing the regulation of stiffness in aged aorta.
Combination of the <mark>histone deacetylase</mark> inhibitor depsipeptide and 5-fluorouracil upregulates <mark>major histocompatibility complex class II</mark> and <mark>p21</mark> genes and activates <mark>caspase-3/7</mark> in human colon cancer HCT-116 cells.
Epigenetic anticancer drugs such as <mark>histone deacetylase</mark> (<mark>HDAC</mark>) inhibitors have been combined with existing anticancer drugs for synergistic or additive effects.
In the present study, we found that a very low concentration of depsipeptide, an <mark>HDAC</mark> inhibitor, potentiated the antitumor activity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in a human colon cancer cell model using HCT-116, HT29, and SW48 cells via the inhibition of colony formation ability or cellular viability.
Exposure to a combination of 5-FU (1.75 µM) and 1 nM depsipeptide for 24 and 48 h resulted in a 3- to 4-fold increase in activated <mark>caspase-3/7</mark>, while 5-FU alone failed to activate <mark>caspase-3/7</mark>.
Microarray and subsequent gene ontology analyses revealed that compared to 5-FU or depsipeptide alone, the combination treatment of 5-FU and depsipeptide upregulated genes related to cell death and the apoptotic process consistent with the inhibition of colony formation and <mark>caspase-3/7</mark> activation.
These analyses indicated marked upregulation of antigen processing and presentation of peptide or polysaccharide antigen via <mark>major histoco<mark>histocompatibility complex (MHC) class</mark> (GO:0002504) and <mark>MHC protein complex</mark> (GO:0042611).
Compared with vehicle controls, the cells treated with the combination of 5-FU and depsipeptide showed marked induction (3- to 8.5-fold) of expression of <mark>MHC class II genes</mark>, but not of <mark>MHC class I genes</mark>.
Furthermore, our global analysis of gene expression, which was focused on genes involved in the molecular regulation of <mark>MHC class II genes</mark>, showed enhancement of pro-apoptotic <mark>PCAF</mark> and <mark>CIITA</mark> after the combination of 5-FU and depsipeptide.
These results may indicate a closer relationship between elevation of <mark>MHC class II</mark> expression and cellular apoptosis induced by the combination of depsipeptide and 5-FU.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report that the combination of 5-FU and depsipeptide induces human colon cancer cell apoptosis in a concerted manner with the induction of <mark>MHC class II</mark> gene expression.
<mark>IGFBP1</mark> increases β-cell regeneration by promoting α- to β-cell transdifferentiation.
There is great interest in therapeutically harnessing endogenous regenerative mechanisms to increase the number of β cells in people with diabetes.
By performing whole-genome expression profiling of zebrafish islets, we identified 11 secreted proteins that are upregulated during β-cell regeneration.
We then tested the proteins' ability to potentiate β-cell regeneration in zebrafish at supraphysiological levels.
One protein, <mark>insulin-like growth factor (Igf) binding-protein 1</mark> (<mark>Igfbp1</mark>), potently promoted β-cell regeneration by potentiating α- to β-cell transdifferentiation.
Using various inhibitors and activators of the <mark>Igf</mark> pathway, we show that <mark>Igfbp1</mark> exerts its regenerative effect, at least partly, by inhibiting <mark>Igf</mark> signaling.
<mark>Igfbp1</mark>'s effect on transdifferentiation appears conserved across species: Treating mouse and human islets with recombinant <mark>IGFBP1</mark> in vitro increased the number of cells co-expressing <mark>insulin</mark> and <mark>glucagon</mark> threefold.
Moreover, a prospective human study showed that having high <mark>IGFBP1</mark> levels reduces the risk of developing type-2 diabetes by more than 85%.
Thus, we identify <mark>IGFBP1</mark> as an endogenous promoter of β-cell regeneration and highlight its clinical importance in diabetes.
A role for the yeast <mark>CLIP170</mark> ortholog, the plus-end-tracking protein <mark>Bik1</mark>, and the <mark>Rho1 GTPase</mark> in <mark>Snc1</mark> trafficking.
The diversity of microtubule functions is dependent on the status of <mark>tubulin</mark> C-termini.
To address the physiological role of the C-terminal aromatic residue of <mark>α-tubulin</mark>, a <mark>tub1</mark>-Glu yeast strain expressing an <mark>α-tubulin</mark> devoid of its C-terminal amino acid was used to perform a genome-wide-lethality screen.
The identified synthetic lethal genes suggested links with endocytosis and related processes.
In the <mark>tub1</mark>-Glu strain, the routing of the <mark>v-SNARE</mark> <mark>Snc1</mark> was strongly impaired, with a loss of its polarized distribution in the bud, and <mark>Abp1</mark>, an <mark>actin</mark> patch or endocytic marker, developed comet-tail structures.
<mark>Snc1</mark> trafficking required dynamic microtubules but not <mark>dynein</mark> and <mark>kinesin</mark> motors.
Interestingly, deletion of the microtubule plus-end-tracking protein <mark>Bik1</mark> (a <mark>CLIP170</mark> ortholog), which is preferentially recruited to the C-terminal residue of <mark>α-tubulin</mark>, similarly resulted in <mark>Snc1</mark> trafficking defects.
Finally, constitutively active <mark>Rho1</mark> rescued both <mark>Bik1</mark> localization at the microtubule plus-ends in <mark>tub1</mark>-Glu strain and a correct <mark>Snc1</mark> trafficking in a <mark>Bik1</mark>-dependent manner.
Our results provide the first evidence for a role of microtubule plus-ends in membrane cargo trafficking in yeast, through <mark>Rho1</mark>- and <mark>Bik1</mark>-dependent mechanisms, and highlight the importance of the C-terminal <mark>α-tubulin</mark> amino acid in this process.
Small RNA in situ hybridization in Caenorhabditis elegans, combined with RNA-seq, identifies germline-enriched <mark>microRNAs</mark>.
Over four hundred different microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified in the genome of the model organism the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.
As the germline is dedicated to the preservation of each species, and almost half of all the cells in an adult nematode are germline, it is likely that regulatory miRNAs are important for germline development and maintenance.
In C. elegans the <mark>miR35</mark> family has strong maternal effects, contributing to normal embryogenesis and to adult fecundity.
To determine whether any particular miRNAs are greatly enriched in the C. elegans germline we used RNA-seq to compare the miRNA populations in several germline-defective strains of adult C. elegans worms, including <mark>glp-4</mark>(<mark>germline proliferation-4</mark>), <mark>glh-1</mark>(<mark>germline helicase-1</mark>) and <mark>dcr-1</mark>(<mark>dicer-1</mark>).
Statistical analyses of RNA-seq comparisons identified 13 <mark>miRNAs</mark> that are germline-enriched, including seven members of the well-studied <mark>miR35</mark> family that were reduced as much as 1000-fold in TaqMan qRT PCR <mark>miRNA</mark> assays.
Along with the <mark>miR35</mark>s, six others: <mark>miR-56 (a member of the miR51 family),-70, -2<mark>-70</mark> -<mark>-244</mark>, <mark>-260</mark> an<mark>-788</mark>813</<mark>-4813</mark>, none of which previously considered as such, were also identified by RNA-seq as germline-enriched candidates.
We went on to develop a successful miRNA in situ hybridization protocol for C. elegans, revealing <mark>miR35</mark>s specifically concentrate during oogenesis in the pachytene region of the gonad, and persist throughout early embryogenesis, while in adult animals neither <mark>let-7</mark> nor <mark>miR-228</mark> has a germline-bias.
A steroid like phytochemical Antcin M is an anti-aging reagent that eliminates hyperglycemia-accelerated premature senescence in dermal fibroblasts by direct activation of <mark>Nrf2</mark> and <mark>SIRT-1</mark>.
The present study revealed the anti-aging properties of antcin M (ANM) and elucidated the molecular mechanism underlying the effects.
We found that exposure of human normal dermal fibroblasts (HNDFs) to high-glucose (HG, 30 mM) for 3 days, accelerated G0/G1 phase arrest and senescence.
Indeed, co-treatment with ANM (10 microM) significantly attenuated HG-induced growth arrest and promoted cell proliferation.
Further molecular analysis revealed that ANM blocked the HG-induced reduction in G1-S transition regulatory proteins such as <mark>cyclin D</mark>, <mark>cyclin E</mark>, <mark>CDK4</mark>, <mark>CDK6</mark>, <mark>CDK2</mark> and <mark>protein retinoblastoma</mark> (<mark>pRb</mark>).
In addition, treatment with ANM eliminated HG-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the induction of anti-oxidant genes, <mark>HO-1</mark> and <mark>NQO-1</mark> via transcriptional activation of <mark>Nrf2</mark>.
Moreover, treatment with ANM abolished HG-induced SIPS as evidenced by reduced senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) activity.
This effect was further confirmed by reduction in senescence-associated marker proteins including, <mark>p21CIP1</mark>, <mark>p16INK4A</mark>, and <mark>p53</mark>/<mark>FoxO1</mark> acetylation.
Also, the HG-induced decline in aging-related marker protein <mark>SMP30</mark> was rescued by ANM.
Furthermore, treatment with ANM increased <mark>SIRT-1</mark> expression, and prevented <mark>SIRT-1</mark> depletion.
This protection was consistent with inhibition of <mark>SIRT-1</mark> phosphorylation at Ser47 followed by blocking its upstream kinases, <mark>p38 MAPK</mark> and <mark>JNK/SAPK</mark>.
Further analysis revealed that ANM partially protected HG-induced senescence in <mark>SIRT-1</mark> silenced cells.
A similar effect was also observed in <mark>Nrf2</mark> silenced cells.
However, a complete loss of protection was observed in both <mark>Nrf2</mark> and <mark>SIRT-1</mark> knockdown cells suggesting that both induction of <mark>Nrf2</mark>-mediated anti-oxidant defense and <mark>SIRT-1</mark>-mediated deacetylation activity contribute to the anti-aging properties of ANM in vitro.
Result of in vivo studies shows that ANM-treated C. elegens exhibits an increased survival rate during HG-induced oxidative stress insult.
Furthermore, ANM significantly extended the life span of C. elegans.
Taken together, our results suggest the potential application of ANM in age-related diseases or as a preventive reagent against aging process.
Long-Lived <mark>CD4</mark>+<mark>IFN-γ</mark>+ T Cells rather than Short-Lived <mark>CD4</mark>+<mark>IFN-γ</mark>+<mark>IL-10</mark>+ T Cells Initiate Rapid <mark>IL-10</mark> Production To Suppress Anamnestic T Cell Responses during Secondary Malaria Infection.
<mark>CD4</mark>(+) T cells that produce <mark>IFN-γ</mark> are the source of host-protective <mark>IL-10</mark> during primary infection with a number of different pathogens, including Plasmodium spp.
The fate of these <mark>CD4</mark>(+)<mark>IFN-γ</mark>(+)<mark>IL-10</mark>(+) T cells following clearance of primary infection and their subsequent influence on the course of repeated infections is, however, presently unknown.
In this study, utilizing <mark>IFN-γ</mark>-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and <mark>IL-10</mark>-GFP dual reporter mice, we show that primary malaria infection-induced <mark>CD4</mark>(+)YFP(+)GFP(+) T cells have limited memory potential, do not stably express <mark>IL-10</mark>, and are disproportionately lost from the Ag-experienced <mark>CD4</mark>(+) T cell memory population during the maintenance phase postinfection.
<mark>CD4</mark>(+)YFP(+)GFP(+) T cells generally exhibited a short-lived effector rather than effector memory T cell phenotype postinfection and expressed high levels of <mark>PD-1</mark>, <mark>Lag-3</mark>, and <mark>TIGIT</mark>, indicative of cellular exhaustion.
Consistently, the surviving <mark>CD4</mark>(+)YFP(+)GFP(+) T cell-derived cells were unresponsive and failed to proliferate during the early phase of secondary infection.
In contrast, <mark>CD4</mark>(+)YFP(+)GFP(-) T cell-derived cells expanded rapidly and upregulated <mark>IL-10</mark> expression during secondary infection.
Correspondingly, <mark>CD4</mark>(+) T cells were the major producers within an accelerated and amplified <mark>IL-10</mark> response during the early stage of secondary malaria infection.
Notably, <mark>IL-10</mark> exerted quantitatively stronger regulatory effects on innate and <mark>CD4</mark>(+) T cell responses during primary and secondary infections, respectively.
The results in this study significantly improve our understanding of the durability of <mark>IL-10</mark>-producing <mark>CD4</mark>(+) T cells postinfection and provide information on how <mark>IL-10</mark> may contribute to optimized parasite control and prevention of immune-mediated pathology during repeated malaria infections.
<mark>FANCM</mark> c.5101C>T mutation associates with breast cancer survival and treatment outcome.
Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease, and different tumor characteristics and genetic variation may affect the clinical outcome.
The <mark>FANCM</mark> c.5101C > T nonsense mutation in the Finnish population associates with increased risk of breast cancer, especially for triple-negative breast cancer patients.
To investigate the association of the mutation with disease prognosis, we studied tumor phenotype, treatment outcome, and patient survival in 3,933 invasive breast cancer patients, including 101 <mark>FANCM</mark> c.5101C > T mutation carriers and 3,832 non-carriers.
We also examined association of the mutation with nuclear immunohistochemical staining of DNA repair markers in 1,240 breast tumors.
The <mark>FANCM</mark> c.5101C > T mutation associated with poor 10-year breast cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio (HR)=1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.52, p = 0.018), with a more pronounced survival effect among familial cases (HR = 2.93, 95% CI 1.5-5.76, p = 1.80 × 10(-3) ).
Poor disease outcome of the carriers was also found among the <mark>estrogen receptor</mark> (<mark>ER</mark>) positive subgroup of patients (HR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.09-2.98, p = 0.021).
Reduced survival was seen especially among patients who had not received radiotherapy (HR = 3.43, 95% CI 1.6-7.34, p = 1.50 × 10(-3) ) but not among radiotherapy treated patients (HR = 1.35, 95% CI 0.82-2.23, p = 0.237).
Significant interaction was found between the mutation and radiotherapy (p = 0.040).
Immunohistochemical analyses show that c.5101C > T carriers have reduced PAR-activity.
Our results suggest that <mark>FANCM</mark> c.5101C > T nonsense mutation carriers have a reduced breast cancer survival but postoperative radiotherapy may diminish this survival disadvantage.
<mark>TGF-β1</mark> promotes colorectal cancer immune escape by elevating <mark>B7-H3</mark> and <mark>B7-H4</mark> via the <mark>miR-155</mark>/<mark>miR-143</mark> axis.
<mark>Transforming growth factor-beta 1</mark> (<mark>TGF-β1</mark>) suppresses T cell function, promoting tumor immune escape.
Yet, whether the depression of <mark>TGF-β1</mark> on T cell function is mediated by co-inhibitory molecules <mark>B7-H3</mark> and <mark>B7-H4</mark> remains largely unclear.
Here, we demonstrated that <mark>TGF-β1</mark> elevated the expression of <mark>miR-155</mark> in colorectal cancer cells through <mark>SMAD3</mark> and <mark>SMAD4</mark>.
The upregulated <mark>miR-155</mark> attenuated <mark>miR-143</mark> by inhibiting its direct target, the <mark>transcription factor</mark> <mark>CEBPB</mark>.
Consequently, the direct target genes of <mark>miR-143</mark>, <mark>B7-H3</mark> and <mark>B7-H4</mark>, were augmented in the cytoplasm and membrane of tumor cells.
Over-expression of <mark>B7-H3</mark> and <mark>B7-H4</mark> in HCT-116 cells induced T cells to secrete <mark>TGF-β1</mark> and the immunosuppressive cytokines <mark>IL-2</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, and <mark>IL-17</mark>.
Restoration of <mark>miR-143</mark> inhibited the growth of HCT-116 xenograft tumors in mice, and also repressed the expression of <mark>B7-H3</mark> and <mark>B7-H4</mark> in the tumors.
Thus, this study reveals the mechanism by which <mark>TGF-β1</mark> leads to T cell-mediated tumor evasion through an increase in <mark>B7-H3</mark> and <mark>B7-H4</mark> expression.
<mark>Erythropoietin</mark> does not activate <mark>erythropoietin receptor</mark> signaling or lipolytic pathways in human subcutaneous white adipose tissue in vivo.
BACKGROUND: <mark>Erythropoietin</mark> (<mark>Epo</mark>) exerts direct effects on white adipose tissue (WAT) in mice in addition to its erythropoietic effects, and in humans <mark>Epo</mark> increases resting energy expenditure and affect serum lipid levels, but direct effects of <mark>Epo</mark> in human WAT have not been documented.
We therefore investigated the effects of acute and prolonged <mark>Epo</mark> exposure on human WAT in vivo.
METHOD: Data were obtained from two clinical trials: 1) acute <mark>Epo</mark> exposure (rHuEpo, 400 IU/kg) followed by WAT biopsies after 1 h and 2) 10 weeks treatment with the erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) <mark>Darbepoietin-alpha</mark>.
Biopsies were analyzed by PCR for <mark>Epo receptor</mark> (<mark>Epo-R</mark>) mRNA.
A new and highly specific antibody (A82, Amgen) was used to evaluate the presence of <mark>Epo-R</mark> by western blot analysis in addition to <mark>Epo-R</mark> signaling proteins (<mark>Akt</mark>, <mark>STAT5</mark>, <mark>p70s6k</mark>, <mark>LYN</mark>, and <mark>p38MAPK</mark>), activation of lipolytic pathways (<mark>ATGL</mark>, <mark>HSL</mark>, <mark>CGI-58</mark>, <mark>G0S2</mark>, <mark>Perilipin</mark>, <mark>Cidea</mark>, <mark>Cidec</mark>, <mark>AMPK</mark>, and <mark>ACC</mark>), and mitochondrial biogenesis (<mark>VDAC</mark>, <mark>HSP90</mark>, <mark>PDH</mark>, and <mark>SDHA</mark>).
RESULTS: No evidence of in vivo activation of the <mark>Epo-R</mark> in WAT could be documented despite detectable levels of <mark>Epo-R</mark> mRNA.
CONCLUSION: Thus, in contradiction to animal studies, <mark>Epo</mark> treatment within a physiological relevant range in humans does not exert direct effects in a subcutaneous WAT.
Alcohol consumption and prostate cancer incidence and progression: A Mendelian randomisation study.
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in developed countries, and is a target for risk reduction strategies.
The effects of alcohol consumption on prostate cancer incidence and survival remain unclear, potentially due to methodological limitations of observational studies.
In this study, we investigated the associations of genetic variants in alcohol-metabolising genes with prostate cancer incidence and survival.
We analysed data from 23,868 men with prostate cancer and 23,051 controls from 25 studies within the international PRACTICAL Consortium.
Study-specific associations of 68 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 alcohol-metabolising genes (<mark>Alcohol Dehydrogenases</mark> (<mark>ADHs</mark>) and <mark>Aldehyde Dehydrogenases</mark> (<mark>ALDHs</mark>)) with prostate cancer diagnosis and prostate cancer-specific mortality, by grade, were assessed using logistic and Cox regression models, respectively.
The data across the 25 studies were meta-analysed using fixed-effect and random-effects models.
We found little evidence that variants in alcohol metabolising genes were associated with prostate cancer diagnosis.
Four variants in two genes exceeded the multiple testing threshold for associations with prostate cancer mortality in fixed-effect meta-analyses.
SNPs within <mark>ALDH1A2</mark> associated with prostate cancer mortality were rs1441817 (fixed effects hazard ratio, HRfixed  = 0.78; 95% confidence interval (95%CI):0.66,0.91; p values = 0.002); rs12910509, HRfixed  = 0.76; 95%CI:0.64,0.91; p values = 0.003); and rs8041922 (HRfixed  = 0.76; 95%CI:0.64,0.91; p values = 0.002).
These SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium with each other.
In <mark>ALDH1B1</mark>, rs10973794 (HRfixed  = 1.43; 95%CI:1.14,1.79; p values = 0.002) was associated with prostate cancer mortality in men with low-grade prostate cancer.
These results suggest that alcohol consumption is unlikely to affect prostate cancer incidence, but it may influence disease progression.
Elevated Hypothalamic Glucocorticoid Levels Are Associated With Obesity and Hyperphagia in Male Mice.
Glucocorticoid (Gc) excess, from endogenous overproduction in disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis or exogenous medical therapy, is recognized to cause adverse metabolic side effects.
The <mark>Gc receptor</mark> (<mark>GR</mark>) is widely expressed throughout the body, including brain regions such as the hypothalamus.
However, the extent to which chronic Gcs affect Gc concentrations in the hypothalamus and impact on <mark>GR</mark> and target genes is unknown.
To investigate this, we used a murine model of corticosterone (Cort)-induced obesity and analyzed Cort levels in the hypothalamus and expression of genes relevant to Gc action.
Mice were administered Cort (75 μg/mL) or ethanol (1%, vehicle) in drinking water for 4 weeks.
Cort-treated mice had increased body weight, food intake, and adiposity.
As expected, Cort increased plasma Cort levels at both zeitgeber time 1 and zeitgeber time 13, ablating the diurnal rhythm.
Liquid chromatography dual tandem mass spectrometry revealed a 4-fold increase in hypothalamic Cort, which correlated with circulating levels and concentrations of Cort in other brain regions.
This occurred despite decreased <mark>11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase</mark> (<mark>Hsd11b1</mark>) expression, the gene encoding the enzyme that regenerates active Gcs, whereas efflux transporter <mark>Abcb1</mark> mRNA was unaltered.
In addition, although Cort decreased hypothalamic <mark>GR</mark> (<mark>Nr3c1</mark>) expression 2-fold, the Gc-induced leucine zipper (<mark>Tsc22d3</mark>) mRNA increased, which indicated elevated <mark>GR</mark> activation.
In keeping with the development of hyperphagia and obesity, Cort increased <mark>Agrp</mark>, but there were no changes in <mark>Pomc</mark>, <mark>Npy</mark>, or <mark>Cart</mark> mRNA in the hypothalamus.
In summary, chronic Cort treatment causes chronic increases in hypothalamic Cort levels and a persistent elevation in <mark>Agrp</mark>, a mediator in the development of metabolic disturbances.
Role of <mark>angiotensin II type 1a receptor</mark> in renal injury induced by deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertension.
The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo role of <mark>angiotensin II type 1a (AT1a) receptor</mark> in renal damage as a result of hypertension by using transgenic mice with <mark>AT1a receptor</mark> gene disruption.
Transgenic mice that express human <mark>liver-type fatty acid binding protein</mark> (<mark>L-FABP</mark>) with or without disruption of the <mark>AT1a receptor</mark> gene (<mark>L-FABP</mark>(+/-) <mark>AT1a</mark>(-/-), and <mark>L-FABP</mark>(+/-) <mark>AT1a</mark>(+/+), respectively) were used with urinary <mark>L-FABP</mark> as an indicator of tubulointerstitial damage.
Those female mice were administered subcutaneously deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt tablets plus drinking water that contained 1% saline for 28 d after uninephrectomy.
In <mark>L-FABP</mark>(+/-) <mark>AT1a</mark>(+/+) mice that received DOCA-salt treatment, hypertension was induced and slight expansion of glomerular area, glomerular sclerosis, and tubulointerstitial damage were observed.
In <mark>L-FABP</mark>(+/-) <mark>AT1a</mark>(-/-) mice that received DOCA-salt treatment, hypertension was similarly induced and the degree of glomerular damage was significantly more severe than in <mark>L-FABP</mark>(+/-) <mark>AT1a</mark>(+/+)-DOCA mice.
Urinary <mark>L-FABP</mark> levels were significantly higher in <mark>L-FABP</mark>(+/-) <mark>AT1a</mark>(-/-)-DOCA mice compared with those in <mark>L-FABP</mark>(+/-) <mark>AT1a</mark>(+/+)-DOCA mice.
Hydralazine treatment significantly attenuated renal damage that was found in <mark>L-FABP</mark>(+/-) <mark>AT1a</mark>(-/-)-DOCA mice along with a reduction in blood pressure.
In summary, activation of the <mark>AT1a receptor</mark> may contribute to maintenance of the glomerular structure against hypertensive renal damage.-Hisamichi, M., Kamijo-Ikemori, A., Sugaya, T., Ichikawa, D., Natsuki, T., Hoshino, S., Kimura, K., Shibagaki, Y.

Increased intermediate M1-M2 macrophage polarization and improved cognition in mild cognitive impairment patients on ω-3 supplementation.
Monocyte/macrophages of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) are defective in phagocytosis and degradation <mark>amyloid β1-42</mark> (<mark>Aβ1-42</mark>), but are improved by ω-3 fatty acids (ω-3s).
The hypothesis of this study was that active <mark>Aβ1-42</mark> phagocytosis by macrophages prevents brain amyloidosis and thus maintains cognition.
We studied the effects of self-supplementation with a drink with ω-3s, antioxidants, and resveratrol on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, macrophage M1M2 phenotype [the ratio of inflammatory cluster of differentiation <mark>(CD)54</mark>+<mark>CD80</mark> and proresolution markers <mark>CD163</mark>+<mark>CD206</mark>], and <mark>Aβ1-42</mark> phagocytosis in patients initially diagnosed as having MCI or subjective cognitive impairment (SCI).
At baseline, the median MMSE score in patients in both the <mark>apolipoprotein E</mark> (<mark>ApoE</mark>) ε3/ε3 and <mark>ApoE</mark> ε3/ε4 groups was 26.0 and macrophage <mark>Aβ1-42</mark> phagocytosis was defective.
The MMSE rate of change increased in the <mark>ApoE</mark> ε3/ε3 group a median 2.2 points per year (P = 0.015 compared to 0) but did not change in the <mark>ApoE</mark> ε3/ε4 group (P = 0.014 between groups).
In the <mark>ApoE</mark> ε3/ε3 group, all patients remained cognitively stable or improved; in the <mark>ApoE</mark> ε3/ε4 group, 1 recovered from dementia, but 3 lapsed into dementia.
The macrophage phenotype polarized in patients bearing <mark>ApoE</mark> ε3/ε3 to an intermediate (green zone) M1-M2 type at the rate of 0.226 U/yr, whereas in patients bearing <mark>ApoE</mark> ε3/ε4, polarization was negative (P = 0.08 between groups).
The baseline M1M2 type in the extreme M1 (red zone) or M2 (white zone) was unfavorable for cognitive outcome.
<mark>Aβ1-42</mark> phagocytosis increased in both <mark>ApoE</mark> groups (P = 0.03 in each groups).
In vitro, the lipidic mediator resolvin D1 (RvD1) down regulated the M1 type in patients with <mark>ApoE</mark> ε3/ε3 but in some patients with ε3/ε4, paradoxically up-regulated the M1 type.
Antioxidant/ω-3/resveratrol supplementation was associated with favorable immune and cognitive responses in <mark>ApoE</mark> ε3/ε3 and individual patients bearing <mark>ApoE</mark> ε3/ε4, and brings into personalized clinical practice the immune benefits expected from ω-3 mediators called resolvins.
The validity of this study is limited by its small size and uncontrolled design.-Famenini, S., Rigali, E. A., Olivera-Perez, H. M., Dang, J., Chang, M T., Halder, R., Rao, R. V., Pellegrini, M., Porter, V., Bredesen, D., Fiala, M. Increased intermediate M1-M2 macrophage polarization and improved cognition in mild cognitive impairment patients on ω-3 supplementation.
<mark>Pannexin3</mark> inhibits TNF-α-induced inflammatory response by suppressing <mark>NF-κB</mark> signalling pathway in human dental pulp cells.
Human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) play a crucial role in dental pulp inflammation.
<mark>Pannexin 3</mark> (<mark>Panx3</mark>), a member of <mark>Panxs</mark> (<mark>Pannexins</mark>), has been recently found to be involved in inflammation.
However, the mechanism of <mark>Panx3</mark> in human dental pulp inflammation remains unclear.
In this study, the role of <mark>Panx3</mark> in inflammatory response was firstly explored, and its potential mechanism was proposed.
Immunohistochemical staining showed that <mark>Panx3</mark> levels were diminished in inflamed human and rat dental pulp tissues.
In vitro, <mark>Panx3</mark> expression was significantly down-regulated in HDPCs following a TNF-α challenge in a concentration-dependent way, which reached the lowest level at 10 ng/ml of TNF-α.
Such decrease could be reversed by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor.
Unlike MG132, BAY 11-7082, a NF-κB inhibitor, even reinforced the inhibitory effect of TNF-α.
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to investigate the role of <mark>Panx3</mark> in inflammatory response of HDPCs.
TNF-α-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, <mark>interleukin (IL)-1b</mark> and <mark>IL-6</mark>, were significantly lessened when <mark>Panx3</mark> was overexpressed in HDPCs.
Conversely, <mark>Panx3</mark> knockdown exacerbated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Moreover, Western blot, dual-luciferase reporter assay, immunofluorescence staining, qRT-PCR and ELISA results showed that <mark>Panx3</mark> participated in dental pulp inflammation in a <mark>NF-κB</mark>-dependent manner.
These findings suggested that <mark>Panx3</mark> has a defensive role in dental pulp inflammation, serving as a potential target to be exploited for the intervention of human dental pulp inflammation.
<mark>Catalytically defective receptor protein tyrosine kinase</mark> <mark>PTK7</mark> enhances invasive phenotype by inducing <mark>MMP-9</mark> through activation of <mark>AP-1</mark> and <mark>NF-κB</mark> in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells.
<mark>Protein tyrosine kinase 7</mark> (<mark>PTK7</mark>), a member of the <mark>catalytically defective receptor protein tyrosine kinase</mark> family, is upregulated in various cancers including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
Here, we have explored the molecular mechanism of <mark>PTK7</mark>-dependent invasiveness in ESCC cells.
<mark>PTK7</mark> knockdown reduced gelatin degradation and <mark>MMP-9</mark> secretion in cultures of ESCC TE-10 cells, and showed reduced levels of <mark>MMP9</mark> mRNA using real-time RT-PCR and luciferase reporter assays.
<mark>PTK7</mark> knockdown decreased not only phosphorylation of <mark>NF-κB</mark>, <mark>IκB</mark>, <mark>ERK</mark>, and <mark>JNK</mark>, but also nuclear localization of <mark>NF-κB</mark> and <mark>AP-1</mark> consisting of <mark>c-Fos</mark> and <mark>c-Jun</mark>.
Activation of <mark>AP-1</mark> and <mark>NF-κB</mark> requires <mark>PTK7</mark>-mediated activation of <mark>tyrosine kinases</mark>, including <mark>Src</mark>.
In addition, <mark>NF-κB</mark> activation by <mark>PTK7</mark> involves the <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> signaling pathway.
<mark>PTK7</mark>-mediated upregulation of <mark>MMP9</mark> was also observed in other ESCC cell lines and in three-dimensional cultures of TE-10 cells.
Moreover, <mark>MMP-9</mark> expression positively correlated with <mark>PTK7</mark> expression in ESCC tumor tissue.
These findings demonstrate that <mark>PTK7</mark> upregulates <mark>MMP9</mark> through activation of <mark>AP-1</mark> and <mark>NF-κB</mark> and, thus increases invasive properties of ESCC cells.
The anti-ageing hormone <mark>klotho</mark> induces <mark>Nrf2</mark>-mediated antioxidant defences in human aortic smooth muscle cells.
Vascular ageing in conditions such as atherosclerosis, diabetes and chronic kidney disease, is associated with the activation of the <mark>renin</mark> <mark>angiotensin</mark> system (RAS) and diminished expression of antioxidant defences mediated by the transcription factor <mark>nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2</mark> (<mark>Nrf2</mark>).
The anti-ageing hormone <mark>klotho</mark> promotes longevity and protects against cardiovascular and renal diseases.
<mark>Klotho</mark> has been shown to activate <mark>Nrf2</mark> and attenuate oxidative damage in neuronal cells, however, the mechanisms by which it protects against vascular smooth muscle cell VSMC dysfunction elicited by <mark>Angiotensin II</mark> (<mark>AngII</mark>) remain to be elucidated.
<mark>AngII</mark> contributes to vascular ageing and atherogenesis by enhancing VSMC oxidative stress, senescence and apoptosis.
This study demonstrates that soluble <mark>klotho</mark> (1 nM, 24 hrs) significantly induces expression of <mark>Nrf2</mark> and the antioxidant enzymes <mark>haeme oxygenase</mark> (<mark>HO-1</mark>) and <mark>peroxiredoxin-1</mark> (<mark>Prx-1</mark>) and enhances glutathione levels in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC).
Silencing of <mark>Nrf2</mark> attenuated the induction of <mark>HO-1</mark> and <mark>Prx-1</mark> expression by soluble <mark>klotho</mark>.
Furthermore, soluble <mark>klotho</mark> protected against <mark>AngII</mark>-mediated HASMC apoptosis and senescence via activation of <mark>Nrf2</mark>.
Thus, our findings highlight a novel <mark>Nrf2</mark>-mediated mechanism underlying the protective actions of soluble <mark>klotho</mark> in HAMSC.
Targeting <mark>klotho</mark> may thus represent a therapeutic strategy against VSMC dysfunction and cardiovascular ageing.
<mark>MicroRNA</mark> deep sequencing in two adult stem cell populations identifies <mark>miR-501</mark> as a novel regulator of <mark>myosin heavy chain</mark> during muscle regeneration.
<mark>MicroRNAs</mark> (<mark>miRNA</mark>s) are important regulators of skeletal muscle regeneration, but the underlying mechanisms are still incompletely understood.
Here, comparative <mark>miRNA</mark> sequencing analysis of myogenic progenitor cells (MPs) and non-myogenic fibroblast-adipocyte progenitors (FAPs) during cardiotoxin (CTX)-induced muscle injury uncovered <mark>miR-501</mark> as a novel muscle-specific <mark>miRNA</mark>.
<mark>miR-501</mark> is an intronic <mark>miRNA</mark> and its expression levels in MPs correlated with its host gene, <mark>chloride channel, voltage-sensitive 5</mark> (<mark>Clcn5</mark>).
Pharmacological inhibition of <mark>miR-501</mark> dramatically blunted the induction of embryonic <mark>myosin heavy chain</mark> (<mark>MYH3</mark>) and, to a lesser extent, <mark>adult myosin isoforms</mark> during muscle regeneration, and promoted small-diameter neofibers.
An unbiased target identification approach in primary myoblasts validated <mark>gigaxonin</mark> as a target of <mark>miR-501</mark> that mimicked the effect of <mark>miR-501</mark> inhibition on <mark>MYH3</mark> expression.
In the mdx mouse model, which models a pathological disease state, not only was <mark>miR-501</mark> induced in regenerating skeletal muscle, but also its serum levels were increased, which correlated with the disease state of the animals.
Our results suggest that <mark>miR-501</mark> plays a key role in adult muscle regeneration and might serve as a novel serum biomarker for the activation of adult muscle stem cells.
Reduced <mark>adiponectin</mark> expression after high-fat diet is associated with selective up-regulation of <mark>ALDH1A1</mark> and further <mark>retinoic acid receptor</mark> signaling in adipose tissue.
<mark>Adiponectin</mark> is an adipocyte-derived <mark>adipokine</mark> with potent antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antiatherogenic activity.
Long-term, high-fat diet results in gain of body weight, adiposity, further inflammatory-based cardiovascular diseases, and reduced <mark>adiponectin</mark> secretion.
Vitamin A derivatives/retinoids are involved in several of these processes, which mainly take place in white adipose tissue (WAT).
In this study, we examined <mark>adiponectin</mark> expression as a function of dietary high-fat and high-vitamin A conditions in mice.
A decrease of <mark>adiponectin</mark> expression in addition to an up-regulation of <mark>aldehyde dehydrogenase A1</mark> (<mark>ALDH1A1</mark>), retinoid signaling, and retinoic acid response element signaling was selectively observed in WAT of mice fed a normal-vitamin A, high-fat diet.
Reduced <mark>adiponectin</mark> expression in WAT was also observed in mice fed a high-vitamin A diet.
Adipocyte cell culture revealed that endogenous and synthetic retinoic acid receptor <mark>(RAR)α</<mark>RAR)α</mark>- and <mark>RARγ</mark>-selective agonists, as well as a synthetic <mark>retinoid X receptor</mark> agonist, efficiently reduced <mark>adiponectin</mark> expression, whereas <mark>ALDH1A1</mark> expression only increased with <mark>RAR</mark> agonists.
We conclude that reduced <mark>adiponectin</mark> expression under high-fat dietary conditions is dependent on 1) increased <mark>ALDH1A1</mark> expression in adipocytes, which does not increase all-trans-retinoic acid levels; 2) further <mark>RAR</mark> ligand-induced, WAT-selective, increased retinoic acid response element-mediated signaling; and 3) <mark>RAR</mark> ligand-dependent reduction of <mark>adiponectin</mark> expression.-Landrier, J.-F., Kasiri, E., Karkeni, E., Mihály, J., Béke, G., Weiss, K., Lucas, R., Aydemir, G., Salles, J., Walrand, S., de Lera, A. R., Rühl, R. Reduced <mark>adiponectin</mark> expression after high-fat diet is associated with selective up-regulation of <mark>ALDH1A1</mark> and further retinoic acid receptor signaling in adipose tissue.
Drosophila <mark>vinculin</mark> is more harmful when hyperactive than absent, and can circumvent <mark>integrin</mark> to form adhesion complexes.
<mark>Vinculin</mark> is a highly conserved protein involved in cell adhesion and mechanotransduction, and both gain and loss of its activity causes defective cell behaviour.
Here, we examine how altering <mark>vinculin</mark> activity perturbs <mark>integrin</mark> function within the context of Drosophila development.
Whereas loss of <mark>vinculin</mark> produced relatively minor phenotypes, gain of <mark>vinculin</mark> activity, through a loss of head-tail autoinhibition, caused lethality.
The minimal domain capable of inducing lethality is the <mark>talin</mark>-binding D1 domain, and this appears to require <mark>talin</mark>-binding activity, as lethality was suppressed by competition with single <mark>vinculin</mark>-binding sites from <mark>talin</mark>.
Activated Drosophila <mark>vinculin</mark> triggered the formation of cytoplasmic adhesion complexes through the rod of <mark>talin</mark>, but independently of <mark>integrin</mark>.
These complexes contain a subset of adhesion proteins but no longer link the membrane to actin.
The negative effects of hyperactive <mark>vinculin</mark> were segregated into morphogenetic defects caused by its whole head domain and lethality caused by its D1 domain.
These findings demonstrate the crucial importance of the tight control of the activity of <mark>vinculin</mark>.
<mark>Nebulette</mark> is a powerful cytolinker organizing <mark>desmin</mark> and <mark>actin</mark> in mouse hearts.
In the hearts of patients bearing <mark>nebulette</mark> mutations, a severe general disorganization in cardiomyocytes of the extrasarcomeric <mark>desmin</mark> intermediate filament system is frequently observed.
However, the molecular and functional relationship between the <mark>desmin</mark> cytoskeleton and <mark>nebulette</mark>-containing sarcomeres is still unclear.
Here we report a high-affinity in vitro interaction between <mark>nebulette</mark> and <mark>desmin</mark> filaments.
A major interaction site has been mapped to the <mark>desmin</mark> α-helical rod domain, indicating that the filament core is directly involved in the binding of <mark>nebulette</mark>.
The disease-mutant <mark>desmin</mark> variants E245D and T453I exhibited increased binding affinity for <mark>nebulette</mark>, delayed filament assembly kinetics, and caused significant weakening of networks.
In isolated chick cardiomyocytes and sections from canine heart, we revealed by ground-state depletion and confocal microscopies that module 5 of <mark>nebulette</mark> extends outward from Z-disk-associated <mark>desmin</mark> filaments toward the center of the sarcomere.
Accordingly, in the myocardium of <mark>Des</mark>(-/-) mice, elevated levels of <mark>cardiac actin</<mark>actin</mark> correlated with alterations in the distribution of <mark>nebulette</mark>.
Our data suggest that a well-organized <mark>desmin</mark> network is required to accommodate an optimal conformation of <mark>nebulette</mark> on sarcomeres to bind and recruit <mark>cardiac α-actin</mark>.
Hence we propose that <mark>nebulette</mark> acts in synergy with <mark>nebulin</mark> to reinforce and temporally fine-tune striated muscle relaxation-contraction cycles.
Less is more: low expression of <mark>MT1-MMP</mark> is optimal to promote migration and tumourigenesis of breast cancer cells.
BACKGROUND: <mark>Membrane Type-1 Matrix Metalloproteinase</mark> (<mark>MT1-MMP</mark>) is a multifunctional protease implicated in metastatic progression ostensibly due to its ability to degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) components and allow migration of cells through the basement membrane.
Despite in vitro studies demonstrating this principle, this knowledge has not translated into the use of MMP inhibitors (MMPi) as effective cancer therapeutics, or been corroborated by evidence of in vivo ECM degradation mediated by <mark>MT1-MMP</mark>, suggesting that our understanding of the role of <mark>MT1-MMP</mark> in cancer progression is incomplete.
METHODS: MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cell lines were created that stably overexpress different levels of <mark>MT1-MMP</mark>.
Using 2D culture, we analyzed pro<mark>MMP-2</mark> activation (gelatin zymography), ECM degradation (fluorescent gelatin), <mark>ERK</mark> signaling (immunoblot), cell migration (transwell/scratch closure/time-lapse imaging), and viability (colorimetric substrate) to assess how different <mark>MT1-MMP</mark> levels affect these cellular parameters.
We also utilized Matrigel 3D cell culture and avian embryos to examine how different levels of <mark>MT1-MMP</mark> expression affect morphological changes in 3D culture, and tumourigenecity and extravasation efficiency in vivo.
RESULTS: In 2D culture, breast cancer cells expressing high levels of <mark>MT1-MMP</mark> were capable of widespread ECM degradation and <mark>TIMP-2</mark>-mediated pro<mark>MMP-2</mark> activation, but were not the most migratory.
Instead, cells expressing low levels of <mark>MT1-MMP</mark> were the most migratory, and demonstrated increased viability and <mark>ERK</mark> activation.
In 3D culture, MCF-7 breast cancer cells expressing low levels of <mark>MT1-MMP</mark> demonstrated an invasive protrusive phenotype, whereas cells expressing high levels of <mark>MT1-MMP</mark> demonstrated loss of colony structure and cell fragment release.
Similarly, in vivo analysis demonstrated increased tumourigenecity and metastatic capability for cells expressing low levels of <mark>MT1-MMP</mark>, whereas cells expressing high levels were devoid of these qualities despite the production of functional <mark>MT1-MMP</mark> protein.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that excessive ECM degradation mediated by high levels of <mark>MT1-MMP</mark> is not associated with cell migration and tumourigenesis, while low levels of <mark>MT1-MMP</mark> promote invasion and vascularization in vivo.
<mark>MEK</mark> inhibitors against <mark>MET</mark>-amplified non-small cell lung cancer.
Several <mark>receptor tyrosine kinases</mark> (<mark>RTKs</mark>) including <mark>EGFR</mark>, <mark>ALK</mark>, and <mark>MET</mark> have been identified as therapeutic targets in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Among the downstream pathways of <mark>RTKs</mark>, the <mark>MAPK</mark> pathway is particularly important for cancer cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.
In this study, the effects of <mark>MEK</mark> inhibitors (trametinib and PD0325901) in several NSCLC cell lines with driver gene alterations, especially <mark>RTK</mark> genes, were tested in vitro using an MTT assay, and a wide range of sensitivities was found.
In particular, all the <mark>EGFR</mark>-mutated cell lines were resistant to <mark>MEK</mark> inhibitors, whereas all the <mark>MET</mark>-amplified cell lines were sensitive.
A bioinformatics technique and western blot analyses showed that the <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>AKT</mark> pathway is more activated in <mark>EGFR</mark>-mutated NSCLC than in <mark>MET</mark>-amplified NSCLC, and a <mark>PI3K</mark> inhibitor enhanced the sensitivity to trametinib in the <mark>EGFR</mark>-mutated cell lines, suggesting that this pathway is associated with resistance to <mark>MEK</mark> inhibitors.
Although the HCC827 cell line (<mark>EGFR</mark> mutation) was resistant to <mark>MEK</mark> inhibitors, the HCC827CNXR cell line, whose driver gene shifts from <mark>EGFR</mark> to <mark>MET</mark>, exhibited enhanced sensitivity to <mark>MEK</mark> inhibitors, indicating the biological importance of the <mark>MAPK</mark> pathway for <mark>MET</mark>-amplified NCSLC.
Furthermore, a synergistic effect of crizotinib (a <mark>MET</mark> inhibitor) and trametinib was observed in <mark>MET</mark>-amplified NCLC cell lines.
Our findings indicate that the <mark>MAPK</mark> pathway is biologically important for <mark>MET</mark>-amplified NSCLC and strongly encourage the development of combination therapy with a <mark>MET</mark> inhibitor and a <mark>MEK</mark> inhibitor against <mark>MET</mark>-amplified NSCLC.
Differential expression of <mark>filamin B</mark> splice variants in giant cell tumor cells.
Giant cell tumor of bone (GCT) is the most commonly reported non-malignant bone tumor in Hong Kong.
This kind of tumor usually affects people aged 20-40 years.
Also, it is well known for recurrence locally, especially when the tumor cannot be removed completely.
<mark>Filamins</mark> are <mark>actin-binding proteins</mark> which contain three family members, <mark>filamin A, B and C</mark>.
They are the products of three different genes, <mark>FLNA</mark>, <mark>FLNB</mark> and <mark>FLNC</mark>, which can generate various transcript variants in different cell types.
In this study, we focused on the effects of <mark>FLNBv2</mark> and <mark>FLNBv4</mark> toward GCT cells.
The only difference between <mark>FLNBv2</mark> and <mark>FLNBv4</mark> is that <mark>FLNBv4</mark> does not contain hinge 1 region.
We found that the relative abundance of <mark>FLNBv4</mark> varies among different GCT cell lines while the expression level of <mark>FLNBv4</mark> in normal osteoblasts was only marginally detectable.
In the functional aspect, overexpression of <mark>FLNBv4</mark> led to upregulation of <mark>RANKL</mark>, <mark>OCN</mark>, <mark>OPG</mark> and <mark>RUNX2</mark>, which are closely related to GCT cell survival and differentiation.
Moreover, <mark>FLNBv4</mark> can have a negative effect on cell viability of GCT cells when compare with <mark>FLNBv2</mark>.
In conclusion, splicing variants of <mark>FLNB</mark> are differentially expressed in GCT cells and may play a role in the proliferation and differentiation of tumor cells.
Effects of the Bowen-Conradi syndrome mutation in <mark>EMG1</mark> on its nuclear import, stability and nucleolar recruitment.
Bowen-Conradi syndrome (BCS) is a severe genetic disorder that is characterised by various developmental abnormalities, bone marrow failure and early infant death.
This disease is caused by a single mutation leading to the aspartate 86 to glycine (D86G) exchange in the essential <mark>nucleolar RNA met<mark>RNA methyltransferase</mark> <mark>EMG1</mark>.
<mark>EMG1</mark> is required for the synthesis of the small ribosomal subunit and is involved in modification of the 18S ribosomal RNA.
Here, we identify the pre-ribosomal factors <mark>NOP14</mark>, <mark>NOC4L</mark> and <mark>UTP14A</mark> as members of a nucleolar subcomplex that contains <mark>EMG1</mark> and is required for its recruitment to nucleoli.
The BCS mutation in <mark>EMG1</mark> leads to reduced nucleolar localisation, accumulation of <mark>EMG1</mark>D86G in nuclear foci and its <mark>proteasome</mark>-dependent degradation.
We further show that <mark>EMG1</mark> can be imported into the nucleus by the <mark>importins</mark> (<mark>Imp</mark>) <mark>Impα/β</mark> or <mark>Impβ/7</mark>.
Interestingly, in addition to its role in nuclear import, binding of the <mark>Impβ/7</mark> heterodimer can prevent unspecific aggregation of both <mark>EMG1</mark> and <mark>EMG1</mark>D86G on RNAs in vitro, indicating that the <mark>importins</mark> act as <mark>chaperones</mark> by binding to basic regions of the <mark>RNA methyltransferase</mark>.
Our findings further indicate that in BCS, nuclear disassembly of the import complex and release of <mark>EMG1</mark>D86G lead to its nuclear aggregation and degradation, resulting in the reduced nucleolar recruitment of the <mark>RNA methyltransferase</mark> and defects in the biogenesis of the small ribosomal subunit.
<mark>PTPN22</mark> Is a Critical Regulator of <mark>Fcγ Receptor</mark>-Mediated Neutrophil Activation.
Neutrophils act as a first line of defense against bacterial and fungal infections, but they are also important effectors of acute and chronic inflammation.
Genome-wide association studies have established that the gene encoding the <mark>protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor 22</mark> (<mark>PTPN22</mark>) makes an important contribution to susceptibility to autoimmune disease, notably rheumatoid arthritis.
Although <mark>PTPN22</mark> is most highly expressed in neutrophils, its function in these cells remains poorly characterized.
We show in this article that neutrophil effector functions, including adhesion, production of reactive oxygen species, and degranulation induced by immobilized immune complexes, were reduced in <mark>Ptpn22</mark>(-/-) neutrophils.
Tyrosine phosphorylation of <mark>Lyn</mark> and <mark>Syk</mark> was altered in <mark>Ptpn22</mark>(-/-) neutrophils.
On stimulation with immobilized immune complexes, <mark>Ptpn22</mark>(-/-) neutrophils manifested reduced activation of key signaling intermediates.
<mark>Ptpn22</mark>(-/-) mice were protected from immune complex-mediated arthritis, induced by the transfer of arthritogenic serum.
In contrast, in vivo neutrophil recruitment following thioglycollate-induced peritonitis and in vitro chemotaxis were not affected by lack of <mark>PTPN22</mark>.
Our data suggest an important role for <mark>PTPN22</mark>-dependent dephosphorylation events, which are required to enable full <mark>FcγR</mark>-induced activation, pointing to an important role for this molecule in neutrophil function.
High glucose repatterns human podocyte energy metabolism during differentiation and diabetic nephropathy.
Podocytes play a key role in diabetic nephropathy pathogenesis, but alteration of their metabolism remains unknown in human kidney.
By using a conditionally differentiating human podocyte cell line, we addressed the functional and molecular changes in podocyte energetics during in vitro development or under high glucose conditions.
In 5 mM glucose medium, we observed a stepwise activation of oxidative metabolism during cell differentiation that was characterized by <mark>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α</mark> (<mark>PGC-1α</mark>)-dependent stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and function, with concomitant reduction of the glycolytic enzyme content.
Conversely, when podocytes were cultured in high glucose (20 mM), stepwise oxidative phosphorylation biogenesis was aborted, and a glycolytic switch occurred, with consecutive lactic acidosis.
Expression of the <mark>master <mark>master regulators of oxidative metabolism transcr<mark>transcription factor A mitochondrial</mark>, <mark>PGC-1α</mark>, <mark>AMPK</mark>, and <mark>serine-threonine liver k<mark>liver kinase B1</mark> was altered by high glucose, as well as their downstream signaling networks.
Focused transcriptomics revealed that <mark>myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C</mark> (<mark>MEF2C</mark>) and <mark>myogenic factor 5</mark> (<mark>MYF5</mark>) expression was inhibited by high glucose levels, and endoribonuclease-prepared small interfering RNA-mediated combined inhibition of those transcription factors phenocopied the glycolytic shift that was observed in high glucose conditions.
Accordingly, a reduced expression of <mark>MEF2C</mark>, <mark>MYF5</mark>, and <mark>PGC-1α</mark> was found in kidney tissue sections that were obtained from patients with diabetic nephropathy.
These findings obtained in human samples demonstrate that <mark>MEF2C-M<mark>MEF2C</mark>m<mark>MYF5</mark>-dependent bioenergetic dedifferentiation occurs in podocytes that are confronted with a high-glucose milieu.-Imasawa, T., Obre, E., Bellance, N., Lavie, J., Imasawa, T., Rigothier, C., Delmas, Y., Combe, C., Lacombe, D., Benard, G., Claverol, S., Bonneu, M., Rossignol, R. High glucose repatterns human podocyte energy metabolism during differentiation and diabetic nephropathy.
Seven novel and six de novo <mark>PHEX</mark> gene mutations in patients with hypophosphatemic rickets.
Inactivating mutations in <mark>phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidase on the X chromosome</mark> (<mark>PHEX</mark>) have been identified as a cause of X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH; OMIM 307800).
In the present study, we enrolled 43 patients from 18 unrelated families clinically diagnosed with hypophosphatemic rickets and 250 healthy controls.
For each available individual, all 22 exons with their exon-intron boundaries of the <mark>PHEX</mark> gene were directly sequenced.
The levels of serum <mark>fibroblast growth factor 23</mark> (<mark>FGF23</mark>) were measured as well.
Sequencing analysis detected 17 different <mark>PHEX</mark> gene mutations, and 7 of these were identified as novel: 3 missense mutations, including c.304G>A (p.Gly102Arg) in exon 3, c.229T>C (p.Cys77Arg) in exon 3 and c.824T>C (p.Leu275Pro) in exon 7; 2 deletion mutations, including c.528delT (p.Glu177LysfsX44) in exon 5 and c.1234delA (p.Ser412ValfsX12) in exon 11; and 2 alternative splicing mutations, including c.436_436+1delAG in intron 4 at splicing donor sites and c.1483-1G>C in intron 13 at splicing acceptor sites.
Moreover, 6 mutations were proven to be de novo in 6 sporadic cases and the probands were all females.
No mutations were found in the 250 healthy controls.
The serum levels of <mark>FGF23</mark> varied widely among the patients with XLH, and no significant difference was found when compared with those of the healthy controls.
On the whole, the findings of this study provide new insight into the spectrum of <mark>PHEX</mark> mutations and provide potential evidence of a critical domain in <mark>PHEX</mark> protein.
In addition, the finding of an overlap of the serum <mark>FGF23</mark> levels between the patients with XLH and the healthy controls indicates its limited diagnostic value in XLH.
Autophagy activated by <mark>tuberin</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark>/<mark>p70S6K</mark> suppression is a protective mechanism against local anaesthetics neurotoxicity.
The local anaesthetics (LAs) are widely used for peripheral nerve blocks, epidural anaesthesia, spinal anaesthesia and pain management.
However, exposure to LAs for long duration or at high dosage can provoke potential neuronal damages.
Autophagy is an intracellular bulk degradation process for proteins and organelles.
However, both the effects of LAs on autophagy in neuronal cells and the effects of autophagy on LAs neurotoxicity are not clear.
To answer these questions, both lipid LAs (procaine and tetracaine) and amide LAs (bupivacaine, lidocaine and ropivacaine) were administrated to human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.
Neurotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay, morphological alterations and median death dosage.
Autophagic flux was estimated by autolysosome formation (dual fluorescence LC3 assay), LC3-II generation and <mark>p62</mark> protein degradation (immunoblotting).
Signalling alterations were examined by immunoblotting analysis.
Inhibition of autophagy was achieved by transfection with <mark>beclin-1</mark> siRNA.
We observed that LAs decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner.
The neurotoxicity of LAs was tetracaine > bupivacaine > ropivacaine > procaine > lidocaine.
LAs increased autophagic flux, as reflected by increases in autolysosome formation and LC3-II generation, and decrease in <mark>p62</mark> levels.
Moreover, LAs inhibited <mark>tuberin</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark>/<mark>p70S6K</mark> signalling, a negative regulator of autophagy activation.
Most importantly, autophagy inhibition by <mark>beclin-1</mark> knockdown exacerbated the LAs-provoked cell damage.
Our data suggest that autophagic flux was up-regulated by LAs through inhibition of <mark>tuberin</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark>/<mark>p70S6K</mark> signalling, and autophagy activation served as a protective mechanism against LAs neurotoxicity.
Therefore, autophagy manipulation could be an alternative therapeutic intervention to prevent LAs-induced neuronal damage.
Telocytes: a potential defender in the spleen of <mark>Npc1</mark> mutant mice.
Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (Npc1), is an atypical lysosomal storage disorder caused by autosomal recessive inheritance of mutations in <mark>Npc1</mark> gene.
In the <mark>Npc1</mark> mutant mice (<mark>Npc1</mark>(-/-) ), the initial manifestation is enlarged spleen, concomitant with free cholesterol accumulation.
Telocytes (TCs), a novel type of interstitial cell, exist in a variety of tissues including spleen, presumably thought to be involved in many biological processes such as nursing stem cells and recruiting inflammatory cells.
In this study, we found that the spleen is significantly enlarged in <mark>Npc1</mark>(-/-) mice, and the results from transmission electron microscopy examination and immunostaining using three different TCs markers, <mark>c-Kit</mark>, <mark>CD34</mark> and <mark>Vimentin</mark> revealed significantly increased splenic TCs in <mark>Npc1</mark>(-/-) mice.
Furthermore, hematopoietic stem cells and macrophages were also elevated in <mark>Npc1</mark>(-/-) spleen.
Taken together, our data indicate that splenic TCs might alleviate the progress of splenic malfunction via recruiting hematopoietic stem cells and macrophages.
Role of <mark>protein arginine methyltransferase 5</mark> in inflammation and migration of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis.
To probe the role of <mark>protein arginine methyltransferase 5</mark> (<mark>PRMT5</mark>) in regulating inflammation, cell proliferation, migration and invasion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
FLSs were separated from synovial tissues (STs) from patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA).
An inhibitor of <mark>PRMT5</mark> (EPZ015666) and short interference RNA (siRNA) against <mark>PRMT5</mark> were used to inhibit <mark>PRMT5</mark> expression.
The standard of protein was measured by Western blot or immunofluorescence.
The excretion and genetic expression of inflammatory factors were, respectively, estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Migration and invasion in vitro were detected by Boyden chamber assay.
FLSs proliferation was detected by BrdU incorporation.
Increased <mark>PRMT5</mark> was discovered in STs and FLSs from patients with RA.
In RA FLSs, the level of <mark>PRMT5</mark> was up-regulated by stimulation with <mark>IL-1b</mark> and <mark>TNF-a</mark>.
Inhibition of <mark>PRMT5</mark> by EPZ015666 and siRNA-mediated knockdown reduced
<mark>IL-6</mark> and <mark>IL-8</mark> production, and proliferation of RA FLSs.
In addition, inhibition of <mark>PRMT5</mark> decreased in vitro migration and invasion of RA FLSs.
Furthermore, EPZ015666 restrained the phosphorylation of <mark>IκB kinaseβ</mark> and <mark>IkBa</mark>, as well as nucleus transsituation of <mark>p65</mark> as well as <mark>AKT</mark> in FLSs.
<mark>PRMT5</mark> regulated the production of inflammatory factors, cell proliferation, migration and invasion of RA FLS, which was mediated by the <mark>NF-κB</mark> and <mark>AKT</mark> pathways.
Our data suggested that targeting <mark>PRMT5</mark> to prevent synovial inflammation and destruction might be a promising therapy for RA.
<mark>Keratin 19</mark> as a key molecule in progression of human hepatocellular carcinomas through invasion and angiogenesis.
BACKGROUND: <mark>Keratin (K) 19</mark>-positive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is well known to have a higher malignant potential than <mark>K19</mark>-negative HCC: However, the molecular mechanisms involved in <mark>K19</mark>-mediated progression of HCC remain unclear.
We attempted to clarify whether <mark>K19</mark> directly affects cell survival and invasiveness in association with cellular senescence or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in <mark>K19</mark>-positive HCC.
METHODS: <mark>K19</mark> expression was analysed in 136 HCC surgical specimens.
The relationship of <mark>K19</mark> with clinicopathological factors and survival was analysed.
Further, the effect of <mark>K19</mark> on cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis was examined by silencing <mark>K19</mark> in the human HCC cell lines, HepG2, HuH-7, and PLC/PRF/5.
Finally, we investigated HCC invasion, proliferation, and angiogenesis using <mark>K19</mark>-positive HCC specimens.
RESULTS: Analysis of HCC surgical specimens revealed that <mark>K19</mark>-positive HCC exhibited higher invasiveness, metastatic potential, and poorer prognosis.
In vitro experiments using the human HCC cell lines revealed that <mark>K19</mark> silencing suppressed cell growth by inducting apoptosis or upregulating <mark>p16</mark> and <mark>p27</mark>, resulting in cellular senescence.
In addition, transfection with <mark>K19</mark> siRNA upregulated <mark>E-cadherin</mark> gene expression, significantly inhibited the invasive capacity of the cells, downregulated angiogenesis-related molecules such as <mark>vasohibin-1</mark> (<mark>VASH1</mark>) and <mark>fibroblast growth factor 1</mark> (<mark>FGFR1</mark>), and upregulated <mark>vasohibin-2</mark> (<mark>VASH2</mark>).
<mark>K19</mark>-positive HCC specimens exhibited a high MIB-1 labelling index, decreased <mark>E-cadherin</mark> expression, and high microvessel density around cancer foci.
CONCLUSION: <mark>K19</mark> directly promotes cancer cell survival, invasion, and angiogenesis, resulting in HCC progression and poor clinical outcome.
<mark>K19</mark> may therefore be a novel drug target for the treatment of <mark>K19</mark>-positive HCC.
In silico SNP analysis of the breast cancer antigen <mark>NY-BR-1</mark>.
BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies with increasing incidences every year and a leading cause of death among women.
Although early stage breast cancer can be effectively treated, there are limited numbers of treatment options available for patients with advanced and metastatic disease.
The novel breast cancer associated antigen <mark>NY-BR-1</mark> was identified by SEREX analysis and is expressed in the majority (>70%) of breast tumors as well as metastases, in normal breast tissue, in testis and occasionally in prostate tissue.
The biological function and regulation of <mark>NY-BR-1</mark> is up to date unknown.
METHODS: We performed an in silico analysis on the genetic variations of the <mark>NY-BR-1</mark> gene using data available in public SNP databases and the tools SIFT, Polyphen and Provean to find possible functional SNPs.
Additionally, we considered the allele frequency of the found damaging SNPs and also analyzed data from an in-house sequencing project of 55 breast cancer samples for recurring SNPs, recorded in dbSNP.
RESULTS: Over 2800 SNPs are recorded in the dbSNP and NHLBI ESP databases for the <mark>NY-BR-1</mark> gene.
Of these, 65 (2.07%) are synonymous SNPs, 191 (6.09%) are non-synoymous SNPs, and 2430 (77.48%) are noncoding intronic SNPs.
As a result, 69 non-synoymous SNPs were predicted to be damaging by at least two, and 16 SNPs were predicted as damaging by all three of the used tools.
The SNPs rs200639888, rs367841401 and rs377750885 were categorized as highly damaging by all three tools.
Eight damaging SNPs are located in the <mark>ankyrin</mark> repeat domain (<mark>ANK</mark>), a domain known for its frequent involvement in protein-protein interactions.
No distinctive features could be observed in the allele frequency of the analyzed SNPs.
CONCLUSION: Considering these results we expect to gain more insights into the variations of the <mark>NY-BR-1</mark> gene and their possible impact on giving rise to splice variants and therefore influence the function of <mark>NY-BR-1</mark> in healthy tissue as well as in breast cancer.
Repeated otilonium bromide administration prevents neurotransmitter changes in colon of rats underwent to wrap restraint stress.
Otilonium bromide (OB) is a spasmolytic drug successfully used for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
Its efficacy has been attributed to the block of <mark>L- and T-type Ca(2+) channels</mark> and muscarinic and tachykinin receptors in the smooth muscle.
Furthermore, in healthy rats, repeated OB administration modified neurotransmitter expression and function suggesting other mechanisms of action.
On this basis, we investigated whether repeated OB treatment prevented the functional and neurochemical changes observed in the colon of rats underwent to wrap restrain stress (WRS) a psychosocial stressor considered suitable to reproduce the main IBS signs and symptoms.
In control, WRS and OB/WRS rats functional parameters were measured in vivo and
morphological investigations were done ex vivo in the colon.
The results showed that OB counteracts most of the neurotransmitters changes caused by WRS.
In particular, the drug prevents the decrease in <mark>SP</mark>-, <mark>NK1r</mark>-, <mark>nNOS</mark>-, <mark>VIP</mark>-, and <mark>S100β</mark>-immunoreactivity (IR) and the increase in <mark>CGRP</mark>-, and <mark>CRF1r</mark>-IR.
On the contrary, OB does not affect the increase in <mark>CRF2r</mark>-IR neurons observed in WRS rats and does not interfere with the mild mucosal inflammation due to WRS.
Finally, OB per se increases the <mark>Mr2</mark> expression in the muscle wall and decreases the number of the myenteric <mark>ChAT</mark>-IR neurons.
Functional findings show a significantly reduction in the number of spontaneous abdominal contraction in OB treated rats.
The ability of OB to block <mark>L-type Ca(2+) channels</mark>, also expressed by enteric neurons, might represent a possible mechanism through which OB exerts its actions.
<mark>Interleukin-10</mark>-mediated regenerative postnatal tissue repair is dependent on regulation of hyaluronan metabolism via fibroblast-specific <mark>STAT3</mark> signaling.
The cytokine <mark>IL-10</mark> has potent antifibrotic effects in models of adult fibrosis, but the mechanisms of action are unclear.
Here, we report a novel finding that <mark>IL-10</mark> triggers a <mark>signal transducer and activator of transcription 3</mark> (<mark>STAT3</mark>)-dependent signaling pathway that regulates hyaluronan (HA) metabolism and drives adult fibroblasts to synthesize an HA-rich pericellular matrix, which mimics the fetal regenerative wound healing phenotype with reduced fibrosis.
By using cre-lox-mediated novel, inducible, fibroblast-, keratinocyte-, and wound-specific <mark>STAT3</mark> knockdown postnatal mice-plus syngeneic fibroblast cell-transplant models-we demonstrate that the regenerative effects of <mark>IL-10</mark> in postnatal wounds are dependent on HA synthesis and fibroblast-specific <mark>STAT3</mark>-dependent signaling.
The importance of <mark>IL-10</mark>-induced HA synthesis for regenerative wound healing is demonstrated by inhibition of HA synthesis in a murine wound model by administering 4-methylumbelliferone.
Although <mark>IL-10</mark> and <mark>STAT3</mark> signaling were intact, the antifibrotic repair phenotype that is induced by <mark>IL-10</mark> overexpression was abrogated in this model.
Our data show a novel role for <mark>IL-10</mark> beyond its accepted immune-regulatory mechanism.
The opportunity for <mark>IL-10</mark> to regulate a fibroblast-specific formation of a regenerative, HA-rich wound extracellular matrix may lead to the development of innovative therapies to attenuate postnatal fibrosis in organ systems or diseases in which dysregulated inflammation and HA intersect.-Balaji, S., Wang, X., King, A., Le, L. D., Bhattacharya, S. S., Moles, C. M., Butte, M. J., de Jesus Perez, V. A., Liechty, K. W., Wight, T. N., Crombleholme, T. M., Bollyky, P. L., Keswani, S. G. <mark>Interleukin-10</mark>-mediated regenerative postnatal tissue repair is dependent on regulation of hyaluronan metabolism via fibroblast-specific <mark>STAT3</mark> signaling.
<mark>Filamin</mark>, a synaptic organizer in Drosophila, determines <mark>glutamate receptor</mark> composition and membrane growth.
<mark>Filamin</mark> is a scaffolding protein that functions in many cells as an actin-crosslinker.
<mark>FLN90</mark>, an isoform of the Drosophila ortholog <mark>Filamin</mark>/<mark>cheerio</mark> that lacks the <mark>actin</mark>-binding domain, is here shown to govern the growth of postsynaptic membrane folds and the composition of <mark>glutamate receptor</mark> clusters at the larval neuromuscular junction.
Genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that <mark>FLN90</mark> is present surrounding synaptic boutons.
<mark>FLN90</mark> is required in the muscle for localization of the <mark>kinase</mark> <mark>dPak</mark> and, downstream of <mark>dPak</mark>, for localization of the <mark>GTPase</mark> <mark>Ral</mark> and the exocyst complex to this region.
Consequently, <mark>Filamin</mark> is needed for growth of the subsynaptic reticulum.
In addition, in the absence of <mark>filamin</mark>, <mark>type-A glutamate receptor</mark> subunits are lacking at the postsynapse, while <mark>type-B</mark> subunits cluster correctly.
Receptor composition is dependent on <mark>dPak</mark>, but independent of the <mark>Ral</mark> pathway.
Thus two major aspects of synapse formation, morphological plasticity and subtype-specific receptor clustering, require postsynaptic <mark>Filamin</mark>.
Whole-Organism Developmental Expression Profiling Identifies <mark>RAB-28</mark> as a Novel Ciliary <mark>GTPase</mark> Associated with the <mark>BBSome</mark> and Intraflagellar Transport.
Primary cilia are specialised sensory and developmental signalling devices extending from the surface of most eukaryotic cells.
Defects in these organelles cause inherited human disorders (ciliopathies) such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), frequently affecting many physiological and developmental processes across multiple organs.
Cilium formation, maintenance and function depend on intracellular transport systems such as intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is driven by <mark>kinesin-2</mark> and IFT-<mark>dynein</mark> motors and regulated by the <mark>Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) cargo-adaptor protein complex</mark>, or <mark>BBSome</mark>.
To identify new cilium-associated genes, we employed the nematode C. elegans, where ciliogenesis occurs within a short timespan during late embryogenesis when most sensory neurons differentiate.
Using whole-organism RNA-Seq libraries, we discovered a signature expression profile highly enriched for transcripts of known ciliary proteins, including <mark>FAM-161</mark> (<mark>FAM161A</mark> orthologue), <mark>CCDC-104</mark> (<mark>CCDC104</mark>), and <mark>RPI-1</mark> (<mark>RP1</mark>/<mark>RP1L1</mark>), which we confirm are cilium-localised in worms.
From a list of 185 candidate ciliary genes, we uncover orthologues of human <mark>MAP9</mark>, <mark>YAP</mark>, <mark>CCDC149</mark>, and <mark>RAB28</mark> as conserved cilium-associated components.
Further analyses of C. elegans <mark>RAB-28</mark>, recently associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, reveal that this small <mark>GTPase</mark> is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons where it dynamically associates with IFT trains.
Whereas inactive GDP-bound <mark>RAB-28</mark> displays no IFT movement and diffuse localisation, GTP-bound (activated) <mark>RAB-28</mark> concentrates at the periciliary membrane in a <mark>BBSome</mark>-dependent manner and undergoes bidirectional IFT.
Functional analyses reveal that whilst cilium structure, sensory function and IFT are seemingly normal in a <mark>rab-28</mark> null allele, overexpression of predicted GDP or GTP locked variants of <mark>RAB-28</mark> perturbs cilium and sensory pore morphogenesis and function.
Collectively, our findings present a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins, and unveil <mark>RAB28</mark>, a <mark>GTPase</mark> most closely related to the BBS protein <mark>RABL4</mark>/<mark>IFT27</mark>, as an IFT-associated cargo with <mark>BBSome</mark>-dependent cell autonomous and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base.
Contribution of upregulated <mark>dipeptidyl peptidase 9</mark> (<mark>DPP9</mark>) in promoting tumoregenicity, metastasis and the prediction of poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
<mark>Dipeptidyl peptidase 9</mark> (<mark>DPP9</mark>) is encoded by <mark>DPP9</mark>, which belongs to the <mark>DPP4</mark> gene family.
Proteins encoded by these genes have unique peptidase and extra-enzymatic functions that have been linked to various diseases including cancers.
Here, we describe the expression pattern and biological function of <mark>DPP9</mark> in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
The repression of <mark>DPP9</mark> expression by small interfering RNA inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.
Moreover, we explored the role of <mark>DPP9</mark> in regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
The epithelial markers <mark>E-cadherin</mark> and <mark>MUC1</mark> were significantly increased, while mesenchymal markers <mark>vimentin</mark> and <mark>S100A4</mark> were markedly decreased in <mark>DPP9</mark> knockdown cells.
The downregulation of <mark>DPP9</mark> in the NSCLC cells induced the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins both in vitro and in vivo.
We investigated the protein expression levels of <mark>DPP9</mark> by tissue microarray immunohistochemical assay (TMA-IHC) (n = 217).
Further we found mRNA expression levels of <mark>DPP9</mark> in 30 pairs of clinical NSCLC tissues were significantly lower than in the adjacent non-cancerous tissues.
Survival analysis showed that the overexpression of <mark>DPP9</mark> was a significant independent factor for poor 5-year overall survival in patients with NSCLC (p = 0.003).
Taken together, <mark>DPP9</mark> expression correlates with poor overall survival in NSCLC.
Long-term exposure of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to ethanol stimulates oncogenic features.
Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for breast cancer.
Little is known regarding the mechanism, although it is assumed that acetaldehyde or estrogen mediated pathways play a role.
We previously showed that long-term exposure to 2.5 mM ethanol (blood alcohol ~0.012%) of MCF-12A, a human normal epithelial breast cell line, induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and oncogenic transformation.
In this study, we investigated in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, whether a similar exposure to ethanol at concentrations ranging up to peak blood levels in heavy drinkers would increase malignant progression.
Short-term (1-week) incubation to ethanol at as low as 1-5 mM (corresponding to blood alcohol concentration of ~0.0048-0.024%) upregulated the stem cell related proteins <mark>Oct4</mark> and <mark>Nanog</mark>, but they were reduced after exposure at 25 mM. Long-term (4-week) exposure to 25 mM ethanol upregulated the <mark>Oct4</mark> and <mark>Nanog</mark> proteins, as well as the malignancy marker <mark>Ceacam6</mark>.
DNA microarray analysis in cells exposed for 1 week showed upregulated expression of metallothionein genes, particularly <mark>MT1X</mark>.
Long-term exposure upregulated expression of some malignancy related genes (<mark>STEAP4</mark>, <mark>SERPINA3</mark>, <mark>SAMD9</mark>, <mark>GDF15</mark>, <mark>KRT15</mark>, <mark>ITGB6</mark>, <mark>TP63</mark>, and <mark>PGR</mark>, as well as the <mark>CEACAM</mark>, <mark>interferon</mark> related, and <mark>HLA</mark> gene families).
Some of these findings were validated by RT-PCR.
A similar treatment also modulated numerous microRNAs (miRs) including one regulator of <mark>Oct4</mark> as well as miRs involved in oncogenesis and/or malignancy, with only a few estrogen-induced miRs.
Long-term 25 mM ethanol also induced a 5.6-fold upregulation of anchorage-independent growth, an indicator of malignant-like features.
Exposure to acetaldehyde resulted in little or no effect comparable to that of ethanol.
The previously shown alcohol induction of oncogenic transformation of normal breast cells is now complemented by the current results suggesting alcohol's potential involvement in malignant progression of breast cancer.
<mark>FGFR1</mark> and <mark>NTRK3</mark> actionable alterations in "Wild-Type" gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
BACKGROUND: About 10-15% of adult, and most pediatric, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) lack mutations in <mark>KIT</mark>, <mark>PDGFRA</mark>, <mark>SDHx</mark>, or <mark>RAS</mark> pathway components (<mark>KRAS</mark>, <mark>BRAF</mark>, <mark>NF1</mark>).
The identification of additional mutated genes in this rare subset of tumors can have important clinical benefit to identify altered biological pathways and select targeted therapies.
METHODS: We performed comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) for coding regions in more than 300 cancer-related genes of 186 GISTs to assess for their somatic alterations.
RESULTS: We identified 24 GIST lacking alterations in the canonical <mark>KIT</mark>/<mark>PDGFRA</mark>/<mark>RAS</mark> pathways, including 12 without <mark>SDHx</mark> alterations.
These 24 patients were mostly adults (96%).
The tumors had a 46% rate of nodal metastases.
These 24 GIST were more commonly mutated at 7 genes: <mark>ARID1B</mark>, <mark>ATR</mark>, <mark>FGFR1</mark>, <mark>LTK</mark>, <mark>SUFU</mark>, <mark>PARK2</mark> and <mark>ZNF217</mark>.
Two tumors harbored <mark>FGFR1</mark> gene fusions (<mark>FGFR1</mark>-<mark>HOOK3</mark>, <mark>FGFR1</mark>-<mark>TACC1</mark>) and one harbored an <mark>ETV6</mark>-<mark>NTRK3</mark> fusion that responded to <mark>TRK</mark> inhibition.
In an independent sample set, we identified 5 GIST cases lacking alterations in the <mark>KIT</mark>/<mark>PDGFRA</mark>/<mark>SDHx</mark>/<mark>RAS</mark> pathways, including two additional cases with <mark>FGFR1</mark>-<mark>TACC1</mark> and <mark>ETV6</mark>-<mark>NTRK3</mark> fusions.
CONCLUSIONS: Using patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and CGP, we show that GIST lacking alterations in canonical genes occur in younger patients, frequently metastasize to lymph nodes, and most contain deleterious genomic alterations, including gene fusions involving <mark>FGFR1</mark> and <mark>NTRK3</mark>.
If confirmed in larger series, routine testing for these translocations may be indicated for this subset of GIST.
Moreover, these findings can be used to guide personalized treatments for patients with GIST.

A Critical Role for the <mark>Type I Interferon Receptor</mark> in Virus-Induced Autoimmune Diabetes in Rats.
The pathogenesis of human type 1 diabetes, characterized by immune-mediated damage of <mark>insulin</mark>-producing β-cells of pancreatic islets, may involve viral infection.
Essential components of the innate immune antiviral response, including <mark>type I interferon</mark> (<mark>IFN</mark>) and <mark>IFN receptor</mark>-mediated signaling pathways, are candidates for determining susceptibility to human type 1 diabetes.
Numerous aspects of human type 1 diabetes pathogenesis are recapitulated in the LEW.1WR1 rat model.
Diabetes can be induced in LEW.1WR1 weanling rats challenged with virus or with the viral mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C).
We hypothesized that disrupting the cognate <mark>type I IFN receptor</mark> (<mark>type I <mark>type I IFN α/β receptor [IFNAR]<<mark>IFNAR</mark>>) to interrupt <mark>IFN</mark> signaling would prevent or delay the development of virus-induced diabetes.
We generated <mark>IFNAR1</mark> subunit-deficient LEW.1WR1 rats using CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9) genome editing and confirmed functional disruption of the <mark>Ifnar1</mark> gene.
<mark>IFNAR1</mark> deficiency significantly delayed the onset and frequency of diabetes and greatly reduced the intensity of insulitis after poly I:C treatment.
The occurrence of Kilham rat virus-induced diabetes was also diminished in <mark>IFNAR1</mark>-deficient animals.
These findings firmly establish that alterations in innate immunity influence the course of autoimmune diabetes and support the use of targeted strategies to limit or prevent the development of type 1 diabetes.
Sertoli Cell <mark>Wt1</mark> Regulates Peritubular Myoid Cell and Fetal Leydig Cell Differentiation during Fetal Testis Development.
Sertoli cells play a significant role in regulating fetal testis compartmentalization to generate testis cords and interstitium during development.
The Sertoli cell <mark>Wilms' tumor 1</mark> (<mark>Wt1</mark>) gene, which encodes ~24 <mark>zinc finger-containing transcription factors</mark>, is known to play a crucial role in fetal testis cord assembly and maintenance.
However, whether <mark>Wt1</mark> regulates fetal testis compartmentalization by modulating the development of peritubular myoid cells (PMCs) and/or fetal Leydig cells (FLCs) remains unknown.
Using a <mark>Wt1</mark>-/flox; Amh-Cre mouse model by deleting <mark>Wt1</mark> in Sertoli cells (Wt1SC-cKO) at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), <mark>Wt1</mark> was found to regulate PMC and FLC development.
<mark>Wt1</mark> deletion in fetal testis Sertoli cells caused aberrant differentiation and proliferation of PMCs, FLCs and interstitial progenitor cells from embryo to newborn, leading to abnormal fetal testis interstitial development.
Specifically, the expression of PMC marker genes <mark>α-Sma,<<mark>α-Sma</mark>> <mark>Myh11</mark> and <mark>Des</mark>, and interstitial progenitor cell marker gene <mark>Vcam1</mark> were down-regulated, whereas FLC marker genes <mark>StAR</mark>, <mark>Cyp11a1</mark>, <mark>Cyp17a1</mark> and <mark>Hsd3b1</mark> were up-regulated, in neonatal <mark>Wt1</mark>SC-cKO testes.
The ratio of PMC:FLC were also reduced in <mark>Wt1</mark>SC-cKO testes, concomitant with a down-regulation of <mark>Notch</mark> signaling molecules <mark>Jag 1</mark>, <mark>Notch 2</mark>, <mark>Notch 3</mark>, and <mark>Hes1</mark> in neonatal <mark>Wt1</mark>SC-cKO testes, illustrating changes in the differentiation status of FLC from their interstitial progenitor cells during fetal testis development.
In summary, <mark>Wt1</mark> regulates the development of FLC and interstitial progenitor cell lineages through <mark>Notch</mark> signaling, and it also plays a role in PMC development.
Collectively, these effects confer fetal testis compartmentalization.
Analysis of cellular and molecular antitumor effects upon inhibition of <mark>SATB1</mark> in glioblastoma cells.
BACKGROUND: The <mark>Special AT-rich Sequence Binding Protein 1</mark> (<mark>SATB1</mark>) regulates the expression of many genes by acting as a global chromatin organizer.
While in many tumor entities <mark>SATB1</mark> overexpression has been observed and connected to pro-tumorigenic processes, somewhat contradictory evidence exists in brain tumors with regard to <mark>SATB1</mark> overexpression in glioblastoma and its association with poorer prognosis and tumor progression.
On the functional side, initial data indicate that <mark>SATB1</mark> may be involved in several tumor cell-relevant processes.
METHODS: For the detailed analysis of the functional relevance and possible therapeutic potential of <mark>SATB1</mark> inhibition, we employ transient siRNA-mediated knockdown and comprehensively analyze the cellular and molecular role of <mark>SATB1</mark> in glioblastoma.
RESULTS: In various cell lines with different <mark>SATB1</mark> expression levels, a <mark>SATB1</mark> gene dose-dependent inhibition of anchorage-dependent and -independent proliferation is observed.
This is due to cell cycle-inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of <mark>SATB1</mark> knockdown.
Molecular analyses reveal <mark>SATB1</mark> knockdown effects on multiple important (proto-) oncogenes, including <mark>Myc</mark>, <mark>Bcl-2</mark>, <mark>Pim-1</mark>, <mark>EGFR</mark>, <mark>β-catenin</mark> and <mark>Survivin</mark>.
Molecules involved in cell cycle, EMT and cell adhesion are affected as well.
The putative therapeutic relevance of <mark>SATB1</mark> inhibition is further supported in an in vivo tumor xenograft mouse model, where the treatment with polymeric nanoparticles containing <mark>SATB1</mark>-specific siRNAs exerts antitumor effects.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that <mark>SATB1</mark> may represent a promising target molecule in glioblastoma therapy whose inhibition or knockdown affects multiple crucial pathways.
<mark>CenpH</mark> regulates meiotic G2/M transition by modulating the <mark>APC/C</mark><mark>Cdh1</mark>-<mark>cyclin B1</mark> pathway in oocytes.
Meiotic resumption (G2/M transition) and progression through meiosis I (MI) are two key stages for producing fertilization-competent eggs.
Here, we report that <mark>CenpH</mark>, a component of the kinetochore inner plate, is responsible for G2/M transition in meiotic mouse oocytes.
Depletion of <mark>CenpH</mark> by morpholino injection decreased <mark>cyclin B1</mark> levels, resulting in attenuation of <mark>maturation-promoting factor</mark> (<mark>MPF</mark>) activation, and severely compromised meiotic resumption.
<mark>CenpH</mark> protects <mark>cyclin B1</mark> from destruction by competing with the action of <mark>APC/C</mark>(<mark>Cdh1</mark>) Impaired G2/M transition after <mark>CenpH</mark> depletion could be rescued by expression of exogenous <mark>cyclin B1</mark>.
Unexpectedly, blocking <mark>CenpH</mark> did not affect spindle organization and meiotic cell cycle progression after germinal vesicle breakdown.
Our findings reveal a novel role of <mark>CenpH</mark> in regulating meiotic G2/M transition by acting via the <mark>APC/C</mark>(<mark>Cdh1</mark>)-<mark>cyclin B1</mark> pathway.
Concordance between <mark>PIK3CA</mark> mutations in endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
BACKGROUND: <mark>PIK3CA</mark> mutations are expected to be potential therapeutic targets for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
We aimed to clarify the concordance between <mark>PIK3CA</mark> mutations detected in endoscopic biopsy specimens and corresponding surgically resected specimens.
METHODS: We examined five hotspot mutations in the <mark>PIK3CA</mark> gene (E542K, E545K, E546K, H1047R, and H1047L) in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections of paired endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens from 181 patients undergoing curative resection for ESCC between 2000 and 2011 using a Luminex technology-based multiplex gene mutation detection kit.
RESULTS: Mutation analyses were successfully performed for both endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens in all the cases.
A <mark>PIK3CA</mark> mutation was detected in either type of specimen in 13 cases (7.2%, 95% confidence interval: 3.9-12.0).
The overall concordance rate, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 98.3% (178/181), 90.9% (10/11), and 98.8% (168/170), respectively.
Among patients with a <mark>PIK3CA</mark> mutation detected in both types of specimens, the concordance between <mark>PIK3CA</mark> mutation genotypes was 100%.
There were three cases with a discordant mutation status between the types of specimens (<mark>PIK3CA</mark> mutation in surgically resected specimen and wild-type in biopsy specimen in two cases, and the opposite pattern in one case), suggesting possible intratumoral heterogeneity in the <mark>PIK3CA</mark> mutation status.
CONCLUSIONS: The <mark>PIK3CA</mark> mutation status was highly concordant between endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens from the same patient, suggesting that endoscopic biopsy specimens can be clinically used to detect <mark>PIK3CA</mark> mutations in patients with ESCC.
Retrospective study of <mark>RAS</mark>/<mark>PIK3CA</mark>/<mark>BRAF</mark> tumor mutations as predictors of response to first-line chemotherapy with bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer patients.
BACKGROUND: After analysis of minor <mark>RAS</mark> mutations (<mark>KRAS</mark> exon 3, 4/<mark>NRAS</mark>) in the FIRE-3 and PRIME studies, an expanded range of <mark>RAS</mark> mutations were established as a negative predictive marker for the efficacy of anti-<mark>EGFR</mark> antibody treatment.
<mark>BRAF</mark> and <mark>PIK3CA</mark> mutations may be candidate biomarkers for anti-<mark>EGFR</mark> targeted therapies.
However, it remains unknown whether <mark>RAS</mark>/<mark>PIK3CA</mark>/<mark>BRAF</mark> tumor mutations can predict the efficacy of bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer.
We assessed whether selection according to <mark>RAS</mark>/<mark>PIK3CA</mark>/<mark>BRAF</mark> mutational status could be beneficial for patients treated with bevacizumab as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer.
METHODS: Of the 1001 consecutive colorectal cancer patients examined for <mark>RAS</mark>, <mark>PIK3CA</mark>, and <mark>BRAF</mark> tumor mutations using a multiplex kit (Luminex®), we studied 90 patients who received combination chemotherapy with bevacizumab as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer.
The objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated according to mutational status.
RESULTS: The ORR was higher among patients with wild-type tumors (64.3%) compared to those with tumors that were only wild type with respect to <mark>KRAS</mark> exon 2 (54.8%), and the differences in ORR between patients with wild-type and mutant-type tumors were greater when considering only <mark>KRAS</mark> exon 2 mutations (6.8%) rather than <mark>RAS</mark>/<mark>PIK3CA</mark>/<mark>BRAF</mark> mutations (18.4%).
There were no statistically significant differences in ORR or PFS between all wild-type tumors and tumors carrying any of the mutations.
Multivariate analysis revealed that liver metastasis and <mark>RAS</mark> and <mark>BRAF</mark> mutations were independent negative factors for disease progression after first-line treatment with bevacizumab.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient selection according to <mark>RAS</mark>/<mark>PIK3CA</mark>/<mark>BRAF</mark> mutations could help select patients who will achieve a better response to bevacizumab treatment.
We found no clinical benefit of restricting combination therapy with bevacizumab for metastatic colorectal cancer patients with <mark>EGFR</mark>-wild type tumors.
Developmental Role of Macrophage <mark>Cannabinoid-1 Receptor</mark> Signaling in Type-2 Diabetes.
Islet inflammation promotes β-cell loss and type-2 diabetes (T2D), a process replicated in Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats in which β-cell loss has been linked to <mark>cannabinoid-1 receptor</mark> (<mark>CB1R</mark>)-induced pro-inflammatory signaling in macrophages infiltrating pancreatic islets.
Here, we analyzed <mark>CB1R</mark> signaling in macrophages and its developmental role in T2Dα.
ZDF rats with global deletion of <mark>CB1R</mark> are protected from β-cell loss, hyperglycemia and nephropathy present in ZDF littermates.
Adoptive transfer of <mark>CB1R</mark>(-/-) bone marrow to ZDF rats also prevents β-cell loss and hyperglycemia, but not nephropathy.
ZDF islets contain elevated levels of <mark>CB1R</mark>, <mark>IL-1b</mark>, <mark>TNF-a</mark>, the <mark>chemokine</mark> <mark>CCL2</mark> and <mark>interferon regulatory factor-5</mark> (<mark>IRF5</mark>), a marker of M1 inflammatory macrophage polarization.
In primary cultured rodent and human macrophages, <mark>CB1R</mark> activation increased <mark>Irf5</mark> expression, whereas knockdown of <mark>Irf5</mark> blunted <mark>CB1R</mark>-induced secretion of inflammatory <mark>cytokines</mark> without affecting <mark>CCL2</mark> expression, which was <mark>p38MAPKα</mark>-dependent.
Macrophage-specific in vivo knockdown of <mark>Irf5</mark> protected ZDF rats from β-cell loss and hyperglycemia.
Thus, <mark>IRF5</mark> is a crucial downstream mediator of diabetogenic <mark>CB1R</mark> signaling in macrophages and a potential therapeutic target.
<mark>TNFα</mark> drives pulmonary arterial hypertension by suppressing the <mark>BMP type-II receptor</mark> and altering <mark>NOTCH</mark> signalling.
Heterozygous germ-line mutations in the <mark>bone morphogenetic protein type-II receptor</mark> (<mark>BMPR-II</mark>) gene underlie heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (HPAH).
Although inflammation promotes PAH, the mechanisms by which inflammation and <mark>BMPR-II</mark> dysfunction conspire to cause disease remain unknown.
Here we identify that <mark>tumour necrosis factor-α</mark> (<mark>TNFα</mark>) selectively reduces <mark>BMPR-II</mark> transcription and mediates post-translational <mark>BMPR-II</mark> cleavage via the sheddases, <mark>ADAM10</mark> and <mark>ADAM17</mark> in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs).
<mark>TNFα</mark>-mediated suppression of <mark>BMPR-II</mark> subverts <mark>BMP</mark> signalling, leading to <mark>BMP6</mark>-mediated PASMC proliferation via preferential activation of an <mark>ALK2</mark>/<mark>ACTR-IIA</mark> signalling axis.
Furthermore, <mark>TNFα</mark>, via <mark>SRC family kinases</mark>, increases pro-proliferative <mark>NOTCH2</mark> signalling in HPAH PASMCs with reduced <mark>BMPR-II</mark> expression.
We confirm this signalling switch in rodent models of PAH and demonstrate that anti-<mark>TNFα</mark> immunotherapy reverses disease progression, restoring normal <mark>BMP</mark>/<mark>NOTCH</mark> signalling.
Collectively, these findings identify mechanisms by which <mark>BMP</mark> and <mark>TNFα</mark> signalling contribute to disease, and suggest a tractable approach for therapeutic intervention in PAH.
Bayesian network inference modeling identifies <mark>TRIB1</mark> as a novel regulator of cell cycle progression and survival in cancer cells.
Molecular networks governing cellular responses to targeted therapies are complex dynamic systems with non-intuitive behaviors.
Here we applied a novel computational strategy to infer probabilistic causal relationships between network components based on gene expression.
We constructed a model comprised of an ensemble of networks using multidimensional data from cell line models of cell cycle arrest caused by inhibition of <mark>MEK1/2</mark>.
Through simulation of reverse-engineered Bayesian network modeling, we generated predictions of G1-S transition.
The model identified known components of the cell cycle machinery, such as <mark>CCND1</mark>, <mark>CCNE2</mark> and <mark>CDC25A</mark>, as well as novel regulators of G1-S transition <mark>IER2</mark>, <mark>TRIB1</mark> and <mark>TRIM27</mark>.
Experimental validation of this model confirmed 10 of 12 predicted genes to have a role in progression through the G1-S phase transition of the cell cycle.
Further analysis showed that <mark>TRIB1</mark> regulated the <mark>cyclin D1</mark> promoter via <mark>NF-κB</mark> and <mark>AP-1</mark> sites and sensitized cells to <mark>TRAIL</mark>-induced apoptosis.
In clinical specimens of breast cancer, <mark>TRIB1</mark> levels correlated with expression of <mark>NF-κB</mark> and its target genes <mark>IL-8</mark> and <mark>CSF2</mark>, and <mark>TRIB1</mark> copy number and expression were predictive of clinical outcome.
Together, our results establish a critical role for <mark>TRIB1</mark> in cell cycle and survival that is mediated via the modulation of <mark>NF-κB</mark> signaling.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor attenuates doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction through activating <mark>Akt</mark> signalling in rats.
The clinical application of doxorubicin (Dox) is limited by its adverse effect of cardiotoxicity.
Previous studies have suggested the cardioprotective effect of <mark>brain-derived neurotrophic factor</mark> (<mark>BDNF</mark>).
We hypothesize that BDNF could protect against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.
Sprague Dawley rats were injected with Dox (2.5 mg/kg, 3 times/week, i.p.), in the presence or absence of recombinant BDNF (0.4 μg/kg, i.v.) for 2 weeks.
H9c2 cells were treated with Dox (1 μM) and/or BDNF (400 ng/ml) for 24 hrs.
Functional roles of BDNF against Dox-induced cardiac injury were examined both in vivo and in vitro.
Protein level of <mark>BDNF</mark> was reduced in Dox-treated rat ventricles, whereas <mark>BDNF</mark> and its receptor <mark>tropomyosin-related kinase B</mark> (<mark>TrkB</mark>) were markedly up-regulated after BDNF administration.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor significantly inhibited Dox-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, oxidative stress and cardiac dysfunction in rats.
Meanwhile, BDNF increased cell viability, inhibited apoptosis and DNA damage of Dox-treated H9c2 cells.
Investigations of the underlying mechanisms revealed that BDNF activated <mark>Akt</mark> and preserved phosphorylation of <mark>mammalian target of rapamycin</mark> and <mark>Bad</mark> without affecting <mark>p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase</mark> and <mark>extracellular regulated protein kinase</mark> pathways.
Furthermore, the beneficial effect of BDNF was abolished by BDNF scavenger TrkB-Fc or <mark>Akt</mark> inhibitor.
In conclusion, our findings reveal a potent protective role of BDNF against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity by activating <mark>Akt</mark> signalling, which may facilitate the safe use of Dox in cancer treatment.
A 22q11.2 amplification in the region encoding <mark>microRNA-650</mark> correlates with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast cancer primary cultures of Mexican patients.
Breast cancer ranks first in incidence and mortality in working age women.
Cancer initiation and progression relies on accumulation of genetic and epigenetic aberrations that alter cellular processes, among them, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) denotes particularly aggressive neoplasias given its capacity to invade and metastasize.
Several <mark>microRNAs</mark> (<mark>miRNA</mark>) have been found able to regulate gene expression at the core of EMT.
In this study, the Affymetrix CytoScan HD array was used to analyze three different primary tumor cell isolates from Mexican breast cancer patients.
We found an amplification in band 22q11.2 shared by the three samples, in the region that encodes <mark>miRNA-650</mark>.
Overexpression of this <mark>miRNA</mark> has been associated with downregulation of tumor suppressors <mark>ING4</mark> and <mark>NDRG2</mark>, which have been implicated in cancer progression.
Using the Pathway Linker platform the <mark>ING4</mark> and <mark>NDRG2</mark> interaction networks showed a significant association with signaling pathways commonly deregulated in cancer.
Also, several studies support their participation in the EMT.
Supporting the latter, we found that the three primary isolates were <mark>E-cadherin</mark> negative, <mark>vimentin</mark> positive, presented a cancer stem cell-like phenotype <mark>CD44</mark>+<mark>CD24</mark>-/low and were invasive in Transwell invasion assays.
This evidence suggests that the gain of region 22q11.2 contributes to trigger EMT.
This is the first evidence linking <mark>miR-650</mark> and breast cancer.
Interference with <mark>Tim-3</mark> protein expression attenuates the invasion of clear cell renal cell carcinoma and aggravates anoikis.
Tumor cells resistant to anoikis are considered to be candidates for metastasis.
In the present study, the role of <mark>Tim 3</mark> in anoikis and its influence on the invasion of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) was investigated.
Here, polyhydroxylethylmethacrylate (poly‑HEMA) was applied to two ccRCC cell lines, 786‑O and Caki‑2, to induce detachment from the extracellular matrix (ECM).
<mark>Tim 3</mark> mRNA and protein expression levels were assayed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) and western blot, respectively.
Anoikis was measured by Ho33342/PI double staining, acridine orange staining, and further determined using the CytoSelect™ 24‑well Anoikis Assay kit.
Apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry, <mark>E‑cadherin</mark> and <mark>N‑cadherin</mark> protein expression were determined using western blotting and a Chemicon cell invasion assay kit was used to quantify the invasive capacity of 786‑O and Caki‑2 cells.
It was demonstrated that detachment from the ECM decreases transcription and the protein expression level of <mark>Tim 3</mark> in 786‑O and Caki‑2 cells compared with control cells.
Interference with <mark>Tim 3</mark> expression using small interfering RNA exacerbated anoikis in 786‑O and Caki‑2 cells induced by poly‑HEMA treatment.
<mark>E cadherin</mark> upregulation, <mark>N cadherin</mark> downregulation, and ECM detachment‑induced reduction in invasion ability were all exacerbated by knockdown of <mark>Tim 3</mark>.
In conclusion, interference with <mark>Tim 3</mark> expression may attenuate the invasion of renal cell carcinoma by aggravating anoikis, indicating <mark>Tim 3</mark> as a potential therapeutic target for treating ccRCC.
Increased frequency of peripheral blood follicular helper T cells and elevated serum <mark>IL 21</mark> levels in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
An aberrant immune response has been implicated in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA).
However, the role of peripheral blood follicular helper T (TFH) cells in the pathogenesis of OA has yet to be elucidated.
The purpose of the present study was to examine the role of TFH cells and serum <mark>interleukin 21</mark> (<mark>IL 21</mark>) in the pathogenesis of OA.
Frequency of peripheral blood <mark>inducible costimulator</mark> (<mark>ICOS</mark>)+, <mark>programmed death 1</mark> (<mark>PD‑1</mark>)+, and <mark>IL 21</mark>+ <mark>CXCR5</mark>+<mark>CD4</mark>+ T cells in 40 patients with OA and 13 healthy controls (HCs) were examined by flow cytometry.
The disease state in individual patients was assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC).
Concentrations of serum <mark>IL 21</mark>, <mark>interferon‑γ</mark> (<mark>INF‑γ</mark>), <mark>IL 4</mark>, <mark>IL 17A</mark>, and <mark>C reactive protein</mark> (<mark>CRP</mark>) were determined, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was measured.
The percentages of <mark>CXCR5</mark>+<mark>CD4</mark>+ cells, <mark>PD‑1</mark>+<mark>CXCR5</mark>+<mark>CD4</mark>+, <mark>ICOS</mark>+<mark>CXCR5</mark>+<mark>CD4</mark>+ and <mark>IL 21</mark>+<mark>CXCR5</mark>+<mark>CD4</mark>+ T cells in OA patients were signiﬁcantly higher than those in the HCs.
Furthermore, serum <mark>IL 21</mark>, <mark>IL 17A</mark> and <mark>IFN g</mark> levels in OA patients were significantly higher than those in HCs.
Expression of <mark>IL 21</mark>+TFH cells in OA patients demonstrated a positive correlation with OA disease activity, <mark>CRP</mark> levels and WOMAC.
TFH cells and <mark>IL 21</mark> appear to serve an important role in the progression of OA.
<mark>IL 21</mark>+TFH cells may prove to be a marker of OA disease activity.
<mark>Syntaxin 2</mark> Acts as Inhibitory <mark>SNARE</mark> for <mark>Insulin</mark> Granule Exocytosis.
Of the four <mark>syntaxins</mark> (<mark>Syns</mark>) specialized for exocytosis, <mark>syntaxin-2</mark> is the least understood.
Here, we employed <mark>syntaxin-2</mark>/<mark>epimorphin</mark> knockout (KO) mice to examine the role of <mark>syntaxin-2</mark> in <mark>insulin</mark> secretory granule (SG) exocytosis.
Unexpectedly, <mark>syntaxin-2</mark> KO mice exhibited paradoxical superior glucose homeostasis resulting from an enhanced <mark>insulin</mark> secretion.
This was confirmed in vitro by pancreatic islet perifusion showing an amplified biphasic glucose-stimulated <mark>insulin</mark> secretion (GSIS) arising from an increase in size of the readily-releasable pool of <mark>insulin</mark> SGs and enhanced SG pool refilling.
The increase in <mark>insulin</mark> exocytosis was attributed mainly from an enhanced recruitment of the larger pool of newcomer SGs that undergoes no residence time on plasma membrane before fusion, and to lesser extent also the predocked SGs.
Consistently, <mark>syntaxin-2</mark> depletion resulted in stimulation-induced increase in abundance of exocytotic complexes we previous demonstrated to mediate the fusion of newcomer SGs (<mark>Syn-3</mark>/<mark>VAMP8</mark>/<mark>SNAP25</mark>/<mark>Munc18b</mark>) and predocked SGs (<mark>Syn-1A</mark>/<mark>VAMP2</mark>/<mark>SNAP25</mark>/<mark>Muncn18a</mark>).
This work is first to show in mammals that <mark>syntaxin-2</mark> could function as inhibitory <mark>SNARE</mark> protein, which when relieved, could promote exocytosis in pancreatic islet β-cells.
Thus, <mark>syntaxin-2</mark> may serve as a potential target to treat diabetes.
Effect of <mark>ART1</mark> on the proliferation and migration of mouse colon carcinoma CT26 cells in vivo.
<mark>Arginine-specific mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase 1</mark> (<mark>ART1</mark>) is an important enzyme that catalyzes arginine-specific mono‑ADP‑ribosylation.
There is evidence that arginine‑specific mono‑ADP‑ribosylation may affect the proliferation of smooth muscle cells via the <mark>Rho</mark>‑dependent signaling pathway.
Previous studies have demonstrated that <mark>ART1</mark> may have a role in the proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of colon carcinoma in vitro.
However, the effect of <mark>ART1</mark> on the proliferation and invasion of colon carcinoma in vivo has yet to be elucidated.
In the present study, mouse colon carcinoma CT26 cells were infected with a lentivirus to produce <mark>ART1</mark> gene silencing or overexpression, and were then subcutaneously transplanted.
To observe the effect of <mark>ART1</mark> on tumor growth or liver metastasis in vivo, a spleen transplant tumor model of CT26 cells in BALB/c mice was successfully constructed.
Expression levels of <mark>focal adhesion kinase</mark> (<mark>FAK</mark>), <mark>Ras homolog gene family member A</mark> (<mark>RhoA</mark>) and the downstream factors, <mark>c‑myc</mark>, <mark>c fos</mark> and <mark>cyclooxygenase 2</mark> (<mark>COX 2</mark>) proteins, were measured in vivo.
The results demonstrated that <mark>ART1</mark> gene silencing inhibited the growth of the spleen transplanted tumor and its ability to spread to the liver via metastasis.
There was also an accompanying increase in expression of <mark>FAK</mark>, <mark>RhoA</mark>, <mark>c‑myc</mark>, <mark>c fos</mark> and <mark>COX 2</mark>, whereas CT26 cells with <mark>ART1</mark> overexpression demonstrated the opposite effect.
These results suggest a potential role for <mark>ART1</mark> in the proliferation and invasion of CT26 cells and a possible mechanism in vivo.
<mark>Dclk1</mark>, a tumor stem cell marker, regulates pro-survival signaling and self-renewal of intestinal tumor cells.
BACKGROUND: More than 80% of intestinal neoplasia is associated with the <mark>adenomatous polyposis coli</mark> (<mark>APC</mark>) mutation.
<mark>Doublecortin-like kinase 1</mark> (<mark>Dclk1</mark>), a kinase protein, is overexpressed in colorectal cancer and specifically marks tumor stem cells (TSCs) that self-renew and increased the tumor progeny in <mark>Apc</mark> (Min/+) mice.
However, the role of <mark>Dclk1</mark> expression and its contribution to regulating pro-survival signaling for tumor progression in <mark>Apc</mark> mutant cancer is poorly understood.
METHODS: We analyzed <mark>DCLK1</mark> and pro-survival signaling gene expression datasets of 329 specimens from TCGA Colon Adenocarcinoma Cancer Data.
The network of <mark>DCLK1</mark> and pro-survival signaling was analyzed utilizing the GeneMANIA database.
We examined the expression levels of <mark>Dclk1</mark> and other stem cell-associated markers, pro-survival signaling pathways, cell self-renewal in the isolated intestinal epithelial cells of <mark>Apc</mark> (Min/+) mice with high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma.
To determine the functional role of <mark>Dclk1</mark> for tumor progression, we knocked down <mark>Dclk1</mark> and determined the pro-survival signaling pathways and stemness.
We used siRNA technology to gene silence pro-survival signaling in colon cancer cells in vitro.
We utilized FACS, IHC, western blot, RT-PCR, and clonogenic (self-renewal) assays.
RESULTS: We found a correlation between <mark>DCLK1</mark> and pro-survival signaling expression.
The expression of <mark>Dclk1</mark> and stem cell-associated markers <mark>Lgr5</mark>, <mark>Bmi1</mark>, and <mark>Musashi1</mark> were significantly higher in the intestinal epithelial cells of <mark>Apc</mark> (Min/+) mice than in wild-type controls.
Intestinal epithelial cells of <mark>Apc</mark> (Min/+) mice showed increased expression of pro-survival signaling, pluripotency and self-renewal ability.
Furthermore, the enteroids formed from the intestinal <mark>Dclk1</mark>(+) cells of <mark>Apc</mark> (Min/+) mice display higher pluripotency and pro-survival signaling.
<mark>Dclk1</mark> knockdown in <mark>Apc</mark> (Min/+) mice attenuates intestinal adenomas and adenocarcinoma, and decreases pro-survival signaling and self-renewal.
Knocking down <mark>RELA</mark> and <mark>NOTCH1</mark> pro-survival signaling and <mark>DCLK1</mark> in HT29 and DLD1 colon cancer cells in vitro reduced the tumor cells' ability to self-renew and survive.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that <mark>Dclk1</mark> is essential in advancing intestinal tumorigenesis.
Knocking down <mark>Dclk1</mark> decreases tumor stemness and progression and is thus predicted to regulate pro-survival signaling and tumor cell pluripotency.
This study provides a strong rationale to target <mark>Dclk1</mark> as a treatment strategy for colorectal cancer.
<mark>Metalloprotease-disintegrin</mark> <mark>ADAM12</mark> actively promotes the stem cell-like phenotype in <mark>claudin</mark>-low breast cancer.
BACKGROUND: <mark>ADAM12</mark> is upregulated in human breast cancers and is a predictor of chemoresistance in <mark>estrogen receptor</mark>-negative tumors.
<mark>ADAM12</mark> is induced during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a feature associated with <mark>claudin</mark>-low breast tumors, which are enriched in cancer stem cell (CSC) markers.
It is currently unknown whether <mark>ADAM12</mark> plays an active role in promoting the CSC phenotype in breast cancer cells.
METHODS: <mark>ADAM12</mark> expression was downregulated in representative <mark>claudin</mark>-low breast cancer cell lines, SUM159PT and Hs578T, using siRNA transfection or inducible shRNA expression.
Cell characteristics commonly associated with the CSC phenotype in vitro (cell migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, mammosphere formation, <mark>ALDH</mark> activity, and expression of the <mark>CD44</mark> and <mark>CD24</mark> cell surface markers) and in vivo (tumor formation in mice using limiting dilution transplantation assays) were evaluated.
RNA sequencing was performed to identify global gene expression changes after <mark>ADAM12</mark> knockdown.
RESULTS: We found that sorted SUM159PT cell populations with high <mark>ADAM12</mark> levels had elevated expression of CSC markers and an increased ability to form mammospheres.
<mark>ADAM12</mark> knockdown reduced cell migration and invasion, decreased anoikis resistance, and compromised mammosphere formation.
<mark>ADAM12</mark> knockdown also diminished ALDEFLUOR(+) and <mark>CD44</mark>(hi)/<mark>CD24</mark>(-/lo) CSC-enriched populations in vitro and reduced tumorigenesis in mice in vivo.
RNA sequencing identified a significant overlap between <mark>ADAM12</mark>- and <mark>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor</mark> (<mark>EGFR</mark>)-regulated genes.
Consequently, <mark>ADAM12</mark> knockdown lowered the basal activation level of <mark>EGFR</mark>, and this effect was abolished by batimastat, a metalloproteinase inhibitor.
Furthermore, incubation of cells with exogenously added EGF prevented the downregulation of <mark>CD44</mark>(hi)/<mark>CD24</mark>(-/lo) cell population by <mark>ADAM12</mark> knockdown.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that <mark>ADAM12</mark> actively supports the CSC phenotype in <mark>claudin</mark>-low breast cancer cells via modulation of the <mark>EGFR</mark> pathway.
<mark>Star-PAP</mark>, a <mark>poly(A) polymerase</mark>, functions as a tumor suppressor in an orthotopic human breast cancer model.
<mark>Star-PAP</mark> is a noncanonical <mark>poly(A) polymerase</mark> and required for the expression of a select set of mRNAs.
However, the pathological role of <mark>Star-PAP</mark> in cancer largely remains unknown.
In this study, we observed decreased expression of <mark>Star-PAP</mark> in breast cancer cell lines and tissues.
Ectopic <mark>Star-PAP</mark> expression inhibited proliferation as well as colony-forming ability of breast cancer cells.
In breast cancer patients, high levels of <mark>Star-PAP</mark> correlated with an improved prognosis.
Moreover, by regulating the expression of <mark>BIK</mark> (<mark>BCL2-interacting killer</mark>), <mark>Star-PAP</mark> induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway.
The growth of breast cancer xenografts in NOD/SCID mice was also inhibited by the doxycycline-induced <mark>Star-PAP</mark> overexpression.
Furthermore, <mark>Star-PAP</mark> sensitized breast cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs both in vitro and in vivo.
In mammary epithelial cells, <mark>Star-PAP</mark> knockdown partially transformed these cells and induced them to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
These findings suggested that <mark>Star-PAP</mark> possesses tumor-suppressing activity and can be a valuable target for developing new cancer therapeutic strategies.
Doxycycline attenuates breast cancer related inflammation by decreasing plasma lysophosphatidate concentrations and inhibiting <mark>NF-κB</mark> activation.
BACKGROUND: We previously discovered that tetracyclines increase the expression of lipid phosphate phosphatases at the surface of cells.
These enzymes degrade circulating lysophosphatidate and therefore doxycycline increases the turnover of plasma lysophosphatidate and decreases its concentration.
Extracellular lysophosphatidate signals through six G protein-coupled receptors and it is a potent promoter of tumor growth, metastasis and chemo-resistance.
These effects depend partly on the stimulation of inflammation that lysophosphatidate produces.
METHODS: In this work, we used a syngeneic orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer to determine the impact of doxycycline on circulating lysophosphatidate concentrations and tumor growth.
Cytokine/chemokine concentrations in tumor tissue and plasma were measured by multiplexing laser bead technology.
Leukocyte infiltration in tumors was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.
The expression of <mark>IL-6</mark> in breast cancer cell lines was determined by RT-PCR.
Cell growth was measured in Matrigel™ 3D culture.
The effects of doxycycline on <mark>NF-κB</mark>-dependent signaling were analyzed by Western blotting.
RESULTS: Doxycycline decreased plasma lysophosphatidate concentrations, delayed tumor growth and decreased the concentrations of several cytokines/chemokines (<mark>IL-1β</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-9</mark>, <mark>CCL2</mark>, <mark>CCL11</mark>, <mark>CXCL1</mark>, <mark>CXCL2</mark>, <mark>CXCL9</mark>, <mark>G-CSF</mark>, <mark>LIF</mark>, <mark>VEGF</mark>) in the tumor.
These results were compatible with the effects of doxycycline in decreasing the numbers of F4/80(+) macrophages and CD31(+) blood vessel endothelial cells in the tumor.
Doxycycline also decreased the lysophosphatidate-induced growth of breast cancer cells in three-dimensional culture.
Lysophosphatidate-induced <mark>Ki-67</mark> expression was inhibited by doxycycline.
<mark>NF-κB</mark> activity in HEK293 cells transiently expressing a <mark>NF-κB</mark>-luciferase reporter vectors was also inhibited by doxycycline.
Treatment of breast cancer cells with doxycycline also decreased the translocation of <mark>NF-κB</mark> to the nucleus and the mRNA levels for <mark>IL-6</mark> in the presence or absence of lysophosphatidate.
CONCLUSION: These results contribute a new dimension for understanding the anti-inflammatory effects of tetracyclines, which make them potential candidates for adjuvant therapy of cancers and other inflammatory diseases.
<mark>TAK1</mark> regulates resident macrophages by protecting lysosomal integrity.
Hematopoietic cell survival and death is critical for development of a functional immune system.
Here, we report that a <mark>protein kinase</mark>, <mark>TAK1</mark>, is selectively required for resident macrophage integrity during embryogenesis.
Hematopoietic lineage-specific deletion of <mark>Tak1</mark> gene (<mark>Tak1</mark>(HKO)) caused accumulation of cellular debris in the thymus in perinatal mice.
Although no overt alteration in thymocytes and blood myeloid populations was observed in <mark>Tak1</mark>(HKO) mice, we found that thymic and lung macrophages were diminished.
In the in vitro setting, <mark>Tak1</mark> deficiency caused profound disruption of lysosomes and killed bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) without any exogenous stressors.
Inhibition of the lysosomal <mark>protease</mark>, <mark>cathepsin B</mark>, partially blocked <mark>Tak1</mark>-deficient BMDM death, suggesting that leakage of the lysosomal contents is in part the cause of cell death.
To identify the trigger of this cell death, we examined involvement of <mark>TNF</mark> and <mark>Toll-like receptor</mark> pathways.
Among them, we found that deletion of <mark>Tnfr1</mark> partially rescued cell death.
Finally, we show that <mark>Tnfr1</mark> deletion partially restored thymic and lung macrophages in vivo.
These results suggest that autocrine and potentially paracrine <mark>TNF</mark> kills <mark>Tak1</mark>-deficient macrophages during development.
Our results reveal that <mark>TAK1</mark> signaling maintains proper macrophage populations through protecting lysosomal integrity.
Activated <mark>niacin receptor</mark> <mark>HCA2</mark> inhibits chemoattractant-mediated macrophage migration via <mark>Gβγ</mark>/<mark>PKC</mark>/<mark>ERK1/2</mark> pathway and heterologous receptor desensitization.
The <mark>niacin receptor</mark> <mark>HCA2</mark> is implicated in controlling inflammatory host responses with yet poorly understood mechanistic basis.
We previously reported that <mark>HCA2</mark> in A431 epithelial cells transduced <mark>Gβγ</mark>-<mark>protein kinase C</mark>- and <mark>Gβγ</mark>-<mark>metalloproteinase</mark>/<mark>EGFR</mark>-dependent <mark>MAPK</mark>/<mark>ERK</mark> signaling cascades.
Here, we investigated the role of <mark>HCA2</mark> in macrophage-mediated inflammation and the underlying mechanisms.
We found that proinflammatory stimulants LPS, <mark>IL-6</mark> and <mark>IL-1β</mark> up-regulated the expression of <mark>HCA2</mark> on macrophages.
Niacin significantly inhibited macrophage chemotaxis in response to chemoattractants fMLF and <mark>CCL2</mark> by disrupting polarized distribution of <mark>F-actin</mark> and <mark>Gβ</mark> protein.
Niacin showed a selected additive effect on chemoattractant-induced activation of <mark>ERK1/2</mark>, <mark>JNK</mark> and <mark>PI3K</mark> pathways, but only the <mark>MEK</mark> inhibitor UO126 reduced niacin-mediated inhibition of macrophage chemotaxis, while activation of <mark>ERK1/2</mark> by EGF alone did not inhibit fMLF-mediated migration of HEK293T cells co-expressing <mark>HCA2</mark> and <mark>fMLF receptor</mark> <mark>FPR1</mark>.
In addition, niacin induced heterologous desensitization and internalization of <mark>FPR1</mark>.
Furthermore, niacin rescued mice from septic shock by diminishing inflammatory symptoms and the effect was abrogated in <mark>HCA2</mark>(-/-) mice.
These results suggest that <mark>Gβγ</mark>/<mark>PKC</mark>-dependent <mark>ERK1/2</mark> activation and heterologous desensitization of chemoattractant receptors are involved in the inhibition of chemoattractant-induced migration of macrophages by niacin.
Thus, <mark>HCA2</mark> plays a critical role in host protection against pro-inflammatory insults.
Oxidized phagosomal <mark>NOX2</mark> is replenished from lysosomes.
In dendritic cells, the <mark>NADPH oxidase 2</mark> (<mark>NOX2</mark>) is recruited to the phagosomal membrane during antigen uptake.
<mark>NOX2</mark> produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the lumen of the phagosome which kill ingested pathogens, delay antigen breakdown and alter the peptide repertoire for presentation to T cells.
How the integral membrane component of <mark>NOX2</mark>, <mark>cytochrome b558</mark>, traffics to phagosomes is incompletely understood.
In this study, we show in dendritic cells derived from human blood-isolated monocytes that <mark>cytochrome b558</mark> is initially recruited to the phagosome from the plasma membrane during phagosome formation.
<mark>Cytochrome b558</mark> also traffics from a lysosomal pool to phagosomes and this is required to replenish oxidatively damaged <mark>NOX2</mark>.
We identified <mark>syntaxin-7</mark>, <mark>SNAP23</mark> and <mark>VAMP8</mark> as the <mark>soluble<mark>soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) <mark>SNARE</mark>ins</mark> mediating this process.
Our data describe a key mechanism of how dendritic cells sustain ROS production after antigen uptake required to initiate T cell responses.
<mark>TIEG1</mark> deficiency confers enhanced myocardial protection in the infarcted heart by mediating the <mark>Pten</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> signalling pathway.
The <mark>transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-inducible early gene-1</mark> (<mark>TIEG1</mark>) plays a crucial role in modulating cell apoptosis and proliferation in a number of diseases, including pancreatic cancer, leukaemia and osteoporosis.
However, the functional role of <mark>TIEG1</mark> in the heart has not been fully defined.
In this study, we first investigated the role of <mark>TIEG1</mark> in ischaemic heart disease.
For in vitro experiments, cardiomyocytes were isolated from both <mark>TIEG1</mark> knockout (KO) and wile-type (WT) mice, and the apoptotic ratios were evaluated after a 48‑h ischaemic insult.
A cell proliferation assay was performed after 7 days of incubation under normoxic conditions.
In addition, the angiogenic capacity of endothelial cells was determined by tube formation assay.
For in vivo experiments, a model of myocardial infarction (MI) was established using both <mark>TIEG1</mark> KO and WT mice.
Echocardiography was performed at 3 and 28 days post-MI, whereas the haemodynamics test was performed 28 days post-MI.
Histological analyses of apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis and infarct zone assessments were performed using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) staining, BrdU immunostaining, <mark>a-smooth muscle actin</mark> (<mark>a-SMA</mark>)/<mark>CD31</mark> immunostaining and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively.
Changes in the expression of related proteins caused by <mark>TIEG1</mark> deficiency were confirmed using both reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis.
Our results demonstrated that the absence of <mark>TIEG1</mark> prevented cardiomyocytes from undergoing apoptosis and promoted higher proliferation; it stimulated the proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo.
Improved cardiac function and less scar formation were observed in <mark>TIEG1</mark> KO mice, and we also observed the altered expression of <mark>phosphatase and tensin homolog</mark> (<mark>Pten</mark>), <mark>Akt</mark> and <mark>Bcl-2</mark>/<mark>Bax</mark>, as well as <mark>vascular endothelial growth factor</mark> (<mark>VEGF</mark>).
On the whole, our findings indicate that the absence of <mark>TIEG1</mark> plays a cardioprotective role in ischaemic heart disease by promoting changes in <mark>Pten</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> signalling.
<mark>NK1.1</mark>(-) <mark>CD4</mark>(+) <mark>NKG2D</mark>(+) T cells suppress DSS-induced colitis in mice through production of <mark>TGF-β</mark>.
<mark>CD4</mark>(+) <mark>NKG2D</mark>(+) T cells are associated with tumour, infection and autoimmune diseases.
Some <mark>CD4</mark>(+) <mark>NKG2D</mark>(+) T cells secrete <mark>IFN-γ</mark> and <mark>TNF-α</mark> to promote inflammation, but others produce <mark>TGF-β</mark> and <mark>FasL</mark> to facilitate tumour evasion.
Here, murine <mark>CD4</mark>(+) <mark>NKG2D</mark>(+) T cells were further classified into <mark>NK1.1</mark>(-) <mark>CD4</mark>(+) <mark>NKG2D</mark>(+) and <mark>NK1.1</mark>(+) <mark>CD4</mark>(+) <mark>NKG2D</mark>(+) subpopulations.
The frequency of <mark>NK1.1</mark>(-) <mark>CD4</mark>(+) <mark>NKG2D</mark>(+) cells decreased in inflamed colons, whereas more <mark>NK1.1</mark>(+) <mark>CD4</mark>(+) <mark>NKG2D</mark>(+) cells infiltrated into colons of mice with DSS-induced colitis.
<mark>NK1.1</mark>(-) <mark>CD4</mark>(+) <mark>NKG2D</mark>(+) cells expressed <mark>TGF-β</mark> and <mark>FasL</mark> without secreting <mark>IFN-γ</mark>, <mark>IL-21</mark> and <mark>IL-17</mark> and displayed no cytotoxicity.
The adoptive transfer of <mark>NK1.1</mark>(-) <mark>CD4</mark>(+) <mark>NKG2D</mark>(+) cells suppressed DSS-induced colitis largely dependent on <mark>TGF-β</mark>.
<mark>NK1.1</mark>(-) <mark>CD4</mark>(+) <mark>NKG2D</mark>(+) cells did not expressed <mark>Foxp3</mark>, <mark>CD223</mark> (<mark>LAG-3</mark>) and <mark>GITR</mark>.
The subpopulation was distinct from <mark>NK1.1</mark>(+) <mark>CD4</mark>(+) <mark>NKG2D</mark>(+) cells in terms of surface markers and RNA transcription.
<mark>NK1.1</mark>(-) <mark>CD4</mark>(+) <mark>NKG2D</mark>(+) cells also differed from Th2 or Th17 cells because the former did not express <mark>GATA-3</mark> and <mark>ROR-γt</mark>.
Thus, <mark>NK1.1</mark>(-) <mark>CD4</mark>(+) <mark>NKG2D</mark>(+) cells exhibited immune regulatory functions, and this T cell subset could be developed to suppress inflammation in clinics.
The novel <mark>mitochondrial matrix protease</mark> <mark>Ste23</mark> is required for efficient presequence degradation and processing.
Around 70% of mitochondrial precursor proteins are imported from the cytosol via N-terminal presequences, which are cleaved upon exposure to the <mark>mitochondrial processing protease</mark> <mark>MPP</mark> in the matrix.
Cleaved presequence peptides then need to be efficiently degraded and impairment of this clearance step e.g. by <mark>amyloid beta</mark> peptides causes a feedback inhibition of <mark>MPP</mark> leading ultimately to accumulation of immature precursor proteins within mitochondria.
Degradation of mitochondrial peptides is performed by <mark>Cym1</mark> in yeast and its homolog <mark>PreP</mark> in humans.
Here we identify the novel <mark>mitochondrial matrix protease</mark> <mark>Ste23</mark> in yeast, a homolog of human <mark>insulin degrading enzyme</mark>, which is required for efficient peptide degradation.
<mark>Ste23</mark> and <mark>Cym1</mark> tightly cooperate to ensure the correct functioning of the essential presequence processing machinery.
<mark>RIPK3</mark> interactions with <mark>MLKL</mark> and <mark>CaMKII</mark> mediate oligodendrocytes death in the developing brain.
Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) death is a key contributor to cerebral white matter injury (WMI) in the developing brain.
A previous study by our group indicated that <mark>receptor-interacting proteins</mark> (<mark>RIPs</mark>) are crucial in mediating necroptosis in developing neurons.
However, whether this mechanism is involved in OPCs death is unclear.
We aimed to explore the mechanisms of <mark>RIP</mark>-mediated oligodendrocytes (OLs) death in the developing brain.
Oligodendrocytes necroptosis was induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation plus <mark>caspase</mark> inhibitor zVAD treatment (OGD/zVAD) in vitro.
Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to detect <mark>RIPK1</mark>, <mark>RIPK3</mark>, <mark>mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein</mark> (<mark>MLKL</mark>), and <mark>Ca(2+) and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIδ</mark> (<mark>CaMKIIδ</mark>).
Immunoprecipitation was used to assess the interactions between <mark>RIPK3</mark> and <mark>RIPK1</mark>, <mark>MLKL</mark>, and <mark>CaMKIIδ</mark>.
Necrostatin-1 was used to disturb the <mark>RIPK3</mark>-<mark>RIPK1</mark> interaction, and siRNA was used to inhibit <mark>RIPK3</mark> or <mark>MLKL</mark> expression.
Oligodendrocytes death was examined using PI staining, EM, and cell membrane leakage assays.
In vivo, brain damage in neonatal rats was induced by hypoxia-ischemia (HI).
This was followed by an examination of myelin development.
We found that OGD/zVAD treatment upregulates the expression of <mark>RIPK3</mark> and the interaction of <mark>RIPK3</mark> with <mark>RIPK1</mark>, <mark>MLKL</mark>, and <mark>CaMKIIδ</mark>.
Inhibition of the <mark>RIPK3</mark>-<mark>MLKL</mark> or <mark>RIPK3</mark>-<mark>CaMKIIδ</mark> interaction attenuates OLs death induced by OGD/zVAD.
These protective mechanisms involve the translocation of <mark>MLKL</mark> to the OLs membrane, and the phosphorylation of <mark>CaMKIIδ</mark>.
However, inhibition of the <mark>RIPK3</mark>-<mark>RIPK1</mark> interaction did not protect OLs death induced by OGD/zVAD.
In vivo studies indicated that the disrupted development of myelin was attenuated after the inhibition of <mark>RIPK3</mark>-<mark>MLKL</mark> or <mark>RIPK3</mark>-<mark>CaMKIIδ</mark> interaction.
Taken together, our data indicate that <mark>RIPK3</mark> is a key factor in protection against OLs death and abnormal myelin development via its interaction with <mark>MLKL</mark> and <mark>CaMKIIδ</mark> after HI.
This suggests that <mark>RIPK3</mark> may be a potential target for the treatment of WMI in neonates.
Wogonin, a plant derived small molecule, exerts potent anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effects through the activation of ROS/<mark>ERK</mark>/<mark>Nrf2</mark> signaling pathways in human Osteoarthritis chondrocytes.
Osteoarthritis (OA), characterized by progressive destruction of articular cartilage, is the most common form of human arthritis.
Here, we evaluated the potential chondroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of Wogonin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, in <mark>IL-1beta</mark>-stimulated human OA chondrocytes and cartilage explants.
Wogonin completely suppressed the expression and production of inflammatory mediators including <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>COX-2</mark>, <mark>PGE2</mark>, <mark>iNOS</mark> and NO in <mark>IL-1beta</mark>-stimulated OA chondrocytes.
Further, Wogonin exhibits potent chondroprotective potential by switching the signaling axis of matrix degradation from catabolic towards anabolic ends and inhibited the expression, production and activities of <mark>matrix degrading proteases</mark> including <mark>MMP-13</mark>, <mark>MMP-3</mark>, <mark>MMP-9</mark>, and <mark>ADAMTS-4</mark> in OA chondrocytes, and blocked the release of s-GAG and <mark>COL2A1</mark> in <mark>IL-1beta</mark>-stimulated OA cartilage explants.
Wogonin also elevated the expression of cartilage anabolic factors <mark>COL2A1</mark> and <mark>ACAN</mark> in chondrocytes and inhibited the <mark>IL-1beta</mark>-mediated depletion of <mark>COL2A1</mark> and proteoglycan content in the matrix of cartilage explants.
The suppressive effect of Wogonin was not mediated through the inhibition of <mark>MAPKs</mark> or <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> activation.
Instead, Wogonin induced mild oxidative stress through the generation of ROS and depletion of cellular GSH, thereby modulating the cellular redox leading to the induction of <mark>Nrf2</mark>/ARE pathways through activation of ROS/<mark>ERK</mark>/<mark>Nrf2</mark>/<mark>HO-1</mark>-<mark>SOD2</mark>-<mark>NQO1</mark>-<mark>GCLC</mark> signaling axis in OA chondrocytes.
Molecular docking studies revealed that Wogonin can disrupt <mark>KEAP-1</mark>/<mark>Nrf-2</mark> interaction by directly blocking the binding site of <mark>Nrf-2</mark> in the <mark>KEAP-1</mark> protein.
Genetic ablation of <mark>Nrf2</mark> using specific siRNA, significantly abrogated the anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective potential of Wogonin in <mark>IL-1beta</mark>-stimulated OA chondrocytes.
Our data indicates that Wogonin exerts chondroprotective effects through the suppression of molecular events involved in oxidative stress, inflammation and matrix degradation in OA chondrocytes and cartilage explants.
The study provides novel insights into the development of <mark>Nrf2</mark> as a promising candidate and Wogonin as a therapeutic agent for the management of OA.
<mark>LEM2</mark> recruits <mark>CHMP7</mark> for <mark>ESCRT</mark>-mediated nuclear envelope closure in fission yeast and human cells.
<mark>Endosomal sorting complexes required for transport III</mark> (<mark>ESCRT-III</mark>) proteins have been implicated in sealing the nuclear envelope in mammals, spindle pole body dynamics in fission yeast, and surveillance of defective nuclear pore complexes in budding yeast.
Here, we report that <mark>Lem2p</mark> (<mark>LEM2</mark>), a member of the <mark>LEM</mark> (<mark>Lap2</mark>-<mark>Emerin</mark>-<mark>Man1</mark>) family of inner nuclear membrane proteins, and the ESCRT-II/ESCRT-III hybrid protein <mark>Cmp7p</mark> (<mark>CHMP7</mark>), work together to recruit additional <mark>ESCRT-III</mark> proteins to holes in the nuclear membrane.
In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, deletion of the <mark>ATPase</mark> <mark>vps4</mark> leads to severe defects in nuclear morphology and integrity.
These phenotypes are suppressed by loss-of-function mutations that arise spontaneously in <mark>lem2</mark> or <mark>cmp7</mark>, implying that these proteins may function upstream in the same pathway.
Building on these genetic interactions, we explored the role of <mark>LEM2</mark> during nuclear envelope reformation in human cells.
We found that <mark>CHMP7</mark> and <mark>LEM2</mark> enrich at the same region of the chromatin disk periphery during this window of cell division and that <mark>CHMP7</mark> can bind directly to the C-terminal domain of <mark>LEM2</mark> in vitro.
We further found that, during nuclear envelope formation, recruitment of the <mark>ESCRT</mark> factors <mark>CHMP7</mark>, <mark>CHMP2A</mark>, and <mark>IST1</mark>/<mark>CHMP8</mark> all depend on <mark>LEM2</mark> in human cells.
We conclude that <mark>Lem2p</mark>/<mark>LEM2</mark> is a conserved nuclear site-specific adaptor that recruits <mark>Cmp7p</mark>/<mark>CHMP7</mark> and downstream <mark>ESCRT</mark> factors to the nuclear envelope.
Activated <mark>ClC-2</mark> Inhibits p-<mark>Akt</mark> to Repress Myelination in GDM Newborn Rats.
This study aims to investigate the effect and mechanism of <mark>type 2 voltage-gated chloride channel</mark> (<mark>ClC-2</mark>) on myelin development of newborn rats' cerebral white matter with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
In this study, GDM model was induced in late pregnant rat model.
The alteration of <mark>ClC-2</mark> expression in various developmental stages of cerebral white matter with/without being exposed to high glucose was analyzed using RT-PCR, active oxygen detection, TUNEL staining, Western Blot as well as immuno-histochemical staining.
Our results showed that <mark>ClC-2</mark> mRNA and protein expressions in GDM group were significantly increased in white matter of fetal rats after E18 stage, and elevated the level of <mark>TNF-alpha</mark> and <mark>iNOS</mark> in white matter at P0 and P3 stage of newborn rats.
Meanwhile, In GDM group, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels of the white matter at E18, P0, and P3 stage were significantly higher than control group.
Furthermore, the expression level of myelin <mark>transcription factor</mark> <mark>Olig2</mark> at P0 stage and <mark>CNPase</mark> at P3 stage were strikingly lower than that of the control group.
In GDM group, <mark>ClC-2</mark> expression in the corpus callosum (CC) and cingulate gyrus (CG) regains, and TUNEL positive cell number were increased at P0 and P3 stage.
However, <mark>PDGFalpha</mark> positive cell number at P0 stage and <mark>CNPase</mark> expression at P3 stage were significantly decreased.
<mark>Caspase-3</mark> was also increased in those white matter regions in GDM group, but p-<mark>Akt</mark> expression was inhibited.
While DIDS (a <mark>chloride channel</mark> blocker) can reverse these changes.
In conclusion, <mark>ClC-2</mark> and <mark>caspase-3</mark> were induced by GDM, which resulted in apoptosis and myelination inhibition.
The effect was caused by repressing <mark>PI3K</mark>-<mark>Akt</mark> signaling pathway.
Application of <mark>ClC-2</mark> inhibitor DIDS showed protective effects on cerebral white matter damage stimulated by high glucose concentration.
<mark>Pleomorphic adenoma gene like-2</mark> induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition via <mark>Wnt</mark>/<mark>b-catenin</mark> signaling pathway in human colorectal adenocarcinoma.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical step in the acquisition of metastatic and invasive power for tumor cells.
Colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) is a common cancer where metastasis is directly linked to patient survival.
Recent studies show that <mark>pleomorphic adenoma gene like-2</mark> (<mark>PLAGL2</mark>) could induce tumor EMT and is an independent predictive factor associated with poor prognosis in cancer.
In the present study, we confirmed the role of <mark>PLAGL2</mark> in the prognosis of CRC patients and provide molecular evidence of <mark>PLAGL2</mark> promoted EMT in CRC cell line SW480.
We found that <mark>PLAGL2</mark> expression was upregulated in the paraffin-embedded CRC tissues compared to borderline or benign tissues.
Experimental EMT induced by <mark>PLAGL2</mark> plasmid transfection proved <mark>PLAGL2</mark> protein overexpression could enhance the cell scratch wound-healing and transwell ability and significantly upregulated mesenchymal marker proteins, <mark>N-cadherin</mark> and <mark>vimentin</mark> and concurrently downregulated epithelial marker of <mark>E-cadherin</mark>.
Subsequently, through western blot assay, we found that <mark>PLAGL2</mark> could activate the <mark>wnt</mark>-signaling component <mark>b-catenin</mark> in the nuclei.
More CRC cell metastasis to the lungs was observed when the <mark>PLAGL2</mark> overexpressing SW480 cells were injected into the tail vein of rats, compared with the cell control and <mark>PLAGL2</mark> silence group.
Our findings indicated that <mark>PLAGL2</mark> might be a very upstream key molecule regulating EMT involved in <mark>Wnt</mark>/<mark>β‑catenin</mark> signaling pathway.
The <mark>tripartite motif-containing protein 3</mark> on the proliferation and <mark>cytokine</mark> secretion of rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes.
Recent studies have revealed fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) as a pivotal effector cell in the inflamed joint of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
FLS exhibit high proliferation rates and constitutive expression of <mark>cytokines</mark>, contributing to the pathogenesis of RA.
In this study, we found that the expression of <mark>tripartite motif-containing protein 3</mark> (<mark>TRIM3</mark>), a candidate tumor suppressor gene, was lower in synovial tissue samples of RA patients than in that of healthy controls.
We then investigated the role of <mark>TRIM3</mark> on the proliferation and <mark>cytokine</mark> secretion of primary cultured FLS from RA patients.
Enforced expression of <mark>TRIM3</mark> in RA FLS led to significantly decreased cell proliferation as indicated by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, reduced secretion of <mark>tumor necrosis factor-α</mark> <mark>(TNF)-α</mark>, <mark>interleukin (IL)-1β</mark> and <mark>IL-6</mark> as indicated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and decreased <mark>p38</mark> phosphorylation as assessed by western blot analysis.
The proteins promoting cell cycles (<mark>cyclin D1</mark> and <mark>PCNA</mark>) were downregulated and the protein negatively regulating cell cycle progression (<mark>p53</mark> and <mark>p21</mark>) was upregulated after <mark>TRIM3</mark> overexpression.
Importantly, <mark>TRIM3</mark> knockdown had reverse effects on cell proliferation, which was suppressed by the <mark>p38</mark>-specific inhibitor SB203580.
In conclusion, the current results demonstrated the downregulation of <mark>TRIM3</mark> expression in RA synovial tissues.
Importantly, <mark>TRIM3</mark> exerted an anti-proliferation role in RA FLS via <mark>p38</mark> signaling pathway.
<mark>Sox2</mark> inhibits <mark>Wnt</mark>-<mark>β-catenin</mark> signaling and metastatic potency of cisplatin-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells.
Lung cancer remains one of the most common cancer-associated mortalities worldwide, and platinum-based doublet chemotherapies are recommended as the first‑line treatment for advanced non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
However, the frequent development of multidrug resistance, to cisplatin regimens in particular, is a major cause of chemotherapy failure in patients with aggressive NSCLC.
<mark>Wnt</mark>/<mark>β‑catenin</mark> signaling and <mark>sex‑determining region Y box 2</mark> (<mark>Sox2</mark>) have been implicated in the development and progression and resistance to <mark>epidermal growth factor receptor</mark>‑targeting therapy in lung cancer.
The present study aimed to explore the effects of <mark>Wnt</mark>/<mark>β‑catenin</mark> and <mark>Sox2</mark> signaling on the chemoresistance of cisplatin‑resistant lung cancer cells by assessing the effects of <mark>Sox2</mark> on <mark>Wnt</mark>/<mark>β‑catenin</mark> signaling activity, cell migration, invasion and clonogenicity, and susceptibility to cisplatin in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells and cisplatin-resistant A549/DDP cells.
The results demonstrated that an enforced expression of <mark>Sox2</mark> led to inhibition of <mark>Wnt</mark>/<mark>β-catenin</mark> signaling activity, potentially by upregulating <mark>glycogen synthase kinase 3 β</mark> in A549 and A549/DDP cells.
An overexpression of <mark>Sox2</mark> promoted cell migration and invasion, in addition to enhancing the clonogenic capacity in A549 cells.
Notably, knockdown <mark>Sox2</mark> using short hairpin RNA led to an enhanced susceptibility of A549 and A549/DDP cells to cisplatin, along with increased cell apoptosis.
The present study thus suggests that <mark>Sox2</mark> may be an important regulator in development of chemoresistance of lung cancer cells and may be a novel therapeutic target for treatment chemoresistant lung cancer.
<mark>IQGAP1</mark>‑siRNA inhibits proliferation and metastasis of U251 and U373 glioma cell lines.
<mark>IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1</mark> (<mark>IQGAP1</mark>) is a scaffold protein, which is aberrantly expressed in several tumor types and is closely associated with the development, metastasis and prognosis of cancer.
Several studies have demonstrated that <mark>IQGAP1</mark> has broad prospects in the basic and clinical research of tumors.
The present study aimed to explore the effects of <mark>IQGAP1</mark>‑small interfering (si) NA on the proliferation and metastasis of U251 and U373 glioma cell lines, which markedly expressed <mark>IQGAP1</mark>.
The human glioma cell lines (U251 and U373) were transfected with siRNA and transfection efficacy was confirmed by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) and western blot analysis.
Cell proliferation was detected using the Cell Counting kit‑8, and cell metastasis capabilities were detected using cell adhesion, migration and invasion assays.
In addition, the expression levels of several tumor‑associated genes were determined by RT‑qPCR and western blotting.
The results indicated that <mark>IQGAP1</mark> was expressed at higher levels in glioma tissues compared with in normal brain tissues.
<mark>IQGAP1</mark>‑siRNA significantly inhibited cell proliferation, and cell adhesion, migration and invasion.
Furthermore, the expression levels of <mark>matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2</mark>, <mark>Snail</mark>, <mark>MMP9</mark>, <mark>fibronectin 1</mark> and <mark>Twist</mark> were suppressed, and <mark>E cadherin</mark> was upregulated in response to siRNA‑<mark>IQGAP1</mark>.
The present study identified the function of <mark>IQGAP1</mark> in glioma cell biology, and indicated that it may be considered a novel target for glioma treatment.
3-Hydroxyterphenyllin, a natural fungal metabolite, induces apoptosis and S phase arrest in human ovarian carcinoma cells.
In the present study, we evaluated 3-Hydroxyter-phenyllin (3-HT) as a potential anticancer agent using the human ovarian cancer cells A2780/CP70 and OVCAR-3, and normal human epithelial ovarian cells IOSE-364 as an in vitro model.
3-HT suppressed proliferation and caused cytotoxicity against A2780/CP70 and OVCAR-3 cells, while it exhibited lower cytotoxicity in IOSE-364 cells.
Subsequently, we found that 3-HT induced S phase arrest and apoptosis in a dose-independent manner.
Further investigation revealed that S phase arrest was related with DNA damage which mediated the <mark>ATM</mark>/<mark>p53</mark>/<mark>Chk2</mark> pathway.
Downregulation of <mark>cyclin D1</mark>, <mark>cyclin A2</mark>, <mark>cyclin E1</mark>, <mark>CDK2</mark>, <mark>CDK4</mark> and <mark>Cdc25C</mark>, and the upregulation of <mark>Cdc25A</mark> and <mark>cyclin B1</mark> led to the accumulation of cells in S phase.
The apoptotic effect was confirmed by Hoechst 33342 staining, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of cleaved <mark>caspase-3</mark> and <mark>PARP1</mark>.
Additional results revealed both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways were involved.
The intrinsic apoptotic pathway was activated through decreasing the protein levels of <mark>Bcl2</mark>, <mark>Bcl-xL</mark> and <mark>procaspase-9</mark> and increasing the protein level of <mark>Puma</mark>.
The induction of <mark>DR5</mark> and <mark>DR4</mark> indicated that the extrinsic apoptotic pathway was also activated.
Induction of ROS and activation of <mark>ERK</mark> were observed in ovarian cancer cells.
We therefore concluded that 3-HT possessed anti-proliferative effect on A2780/CP70 and OVCAR-3 cells, induced S phase arrest and caused apoptosis.
Taken together, we propose that 3-HT shows promise as a therapeutic candidate for treating ovarian cancer.
Induced pluripotent stem cells from patients with focal cortical dysplasia and refractory epilepsy.
Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is caused by numerous alterations, which can be divided into abnormalities of the cortical architecture and cytological variations; however, the exact etiology of FCD remains unknown.
The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the cells of patients with neurological diseases, and their subsequent tissue‑specific differentiation, serves as an invaluable source for testing and studying the initial development and subsequent progression of diseases associated with the central nervous system.
A total of 2 patients demonstrating seizures refractory to drug treatment, characterized as FCD Type IIb, were enrolled in the present study.
Fibroblasts were isolated from residual skin fragments obtained from surgical treatment and from brain samples obtained during surgical resection.
iPSCs were generated following exposure of fibroblasts to viral vectors containing POU class 5 homeobox 1 (OCT4), sex determining region Y‑box 2 (SOX2), Kruppel‑like factor 4 and c‑MYC genes, and were characterized by immunohistochemical staining for the pluripotent markers <mark>homeobox protein</mark> <mark>NANOG</mark>, <mark>SOX2</mark>, <mark>OCT4</mark>, <mark>TRA1‑60</mark> and <mark>TRA1‑81</mark>.
The brain samples were tested with antibodies against <mark>protein kinase B</mark> (<mark>AKT</mark>), phosphorylated‑<mark>AKT</mark>, <mark>mechanistic target of rapamycin</mark> (<mark>mTOR</mark>) and phosphorylated‑<mark>mTOR</mark>.
Analysis of the <mark>AKT</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark> pathway revealed a statistically significant difference between the cerebral tissues of the two patients, which were of different ages (45 and 12 years old).
Clones with the morphological features of embryonic cells were detected on the 13th day and were characterized following three subcultures.
The positive staining characteristics of the embryonic cells confirmed the successful generation of iPSCs derived from the patients' fibroblasts.
Therefore, the present study presents a method to obtain a useful cellular source that may help to understand embryonic brain development associated with FCD.
<mark>Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor</mark>-mediated cell survival in hypoxia depends on the promotion of autophagy via suppression of the <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark> signaling pathway.
Hypoxia is widely accepted as a fundamental biological phenomenon, which is strongly associated with tissue damage and cell viability under stress conditions.
<mark>Insulin-like growth factor‑1</mark> (<mark>IGF‑1</mark>) is known to protect tissues from multiple types of damage, and protect cells from apoptosis.
Hypoxia is a regulatory factor of the <mark>IGF</mark> system, however the role of the <mark>IGF-1 receptor</mark> (<mark>IGF‑1R</mark>) in hypoxia‑induced apoptosis remains unclear.
The present study investigated the potential mechanisms associated with <mark>IGF‑1R</mark>‑associated apoptosis under hypoxic conditions.
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibiting disruption or overexpression of <mark>IGF‑1R</mark> (R‑ cells and R+ cells) were used to examine the level of apoptosis, autophagy, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
The autophagy inhibitor 3‑methyladenine was used to assess the effect of autophagy on ROS production and apoptosis under hypoxic conditions.
A potential downstream signaling pathway involving <mark>phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase</mark> (<mark>PI3K</mark>)/<mark>threonine protein kinase B</mark> (<mark>Akt</mark>)/<mark>mammalian target of rapamycin</mark> (<mark>mTOR</mark>) was identifiedby western blot analysis.
The results demonstrated that hypoxia induced apoptosis, increased ROS production, and promoted autophagy in a time‑dependent manner relative to that observed under normoxia.
R+ cells exhibited a lower percentage of apoptotic cells, lower ROS production, and higher levels of autophagy when compared to that of R- cells.
In addition, inhibition of autophagy led to increased ROS production and a higher percentage of apoptotic cells in the two cell types.
Furthermore, <mark>IGF‑1R</mark> is related with <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark> signaling pathway and enhanced autophagy-associated protein expression, which was verified following treatment with the <mark>PI3K</mark> inhibitor LY294002.
These results indicated that <mark>IGF‑1R</mark> may increase cell viability under hypoxic conditions by promoting autophagy and scavenging ROS production, whic<mark>h</mark> is closed with <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark> signaling pathway.
Atorvastatin protects against contrast-induced nephropathy via anti-apoptosis by the upregulation of <mark>Hsp27</mark> in vivo and in vitro.
Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is an iatrogenic acute renal failure occurring following the intravascular injection of iodinated radiographic contrast medium.
However, the regulatory mechanisms for CIN remain to be fully elucidated.
The present study aimed to investigate whether atorvastatin protects against CIN via anti‑apoptotic effects by the upregulation of <mark>Hsp27</mark> in vivo and in vitro.
To determine whether atorvastatin attenuated CIN, the inflammatory response and apoptosis in vivo and in vitro, a rat model of iopamidol‑induced CIN was used, and human embryonic proximal tubule (HK2) cell damage was assessed.
The rats were assigned into four groups (n=10 per group), as follows: Control rats; rats+atorvastatin; rats + iopamidol; rats+iopamidol+atorvastatin.
In vitro, the HK2 cells were treated with iopamidol in the presence or absence of atorvastatin, <mark>heat shock protein (Hsp)27</mark> small interfering (si)RNA or pcDNA3.1‑<mark>Hsp27</mark>.
The renal tissues were examined histopathologically and collected for western blot analysis.
The results showed that atorvastatin ameliorated the apoptosis and deterioration of renal function (P<0.05).
Furthermore, atorvastatin reduced the iopamidol‑induced activity of <mark>B cell lymphoma‑2</mark> <mark>(Bcl‑2)‑associated X protein</mark> (<mark>Bax</mark>)/<mark>caspase‑3</mark> and increased the expression of <mark>Bcl‑2</mark> in vivo and in vitro.
Notably, following treatment with <mark>Hsp27</mark> siRNA or pcDNA3.1‑<mark>Hsp27</mark>, it was found that iopamidol enhanced or weakened the upregulation of <mark>Bax</mark>/<mark>caspase‑3</mark> and downregulation of <mark>Bcl‑2</mark> in the HK2 cells, respectively.
The results of the present study suggested that atorvastatin protected against contrast‑induced renal tubular cell apoptosis through the upregulation of <mark>Hsp27</mark> in vivo and in vitro.
Inhibition of <mark>triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1</mark> ameliorates experimental autoimmune neuritis.
Experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) is a cluster of differentiation 4+ T helper 1 cell-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disease of the peripheral nervous system and serves as a useful animal model for Guillain‑Barré syndrome.
<mark>Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells‑1</mark> (<mark>TREM‑1</mark>) is an important receptor involved in sepsis and the innate inflammatory response.
Linear plasmid 17 (LP 17) peptide is a competitive antagonist of <mark>TREM‑1</mark>.
To investigate the role of <mark>TREM‑1</mark> in EAN, 64 male Lewis rats were randomly divided into four groups: Normal saline, complete Freund's adjuvant, EAN and LP 17.
The present study assessed the mRNA expression levels of <mark>TREM‑1</mark>, <mark>tumor necrosis factor‑α</mark> and <mark>interleukin‑1β</mark> in sciatic nerves and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
The results demonstrated that inhibiting <mark>TREM-1</mark> by administering LP 17 ameliorated symptoms and reduced inflammation in EAN rats.
The present study concluded that <mark>TREM‑1</mark> may be involved in the pathogenesis of EAN, and that inhibition of <mark>TREM-1</mark> may ameliorate EAN.
Inhibitory effect of emodin on <mark>fatty acid synthase</mark>, colon cancer proliferation and apoptosis.
<mark>Fatty acid synthase</mark> (<mark>FASN</mark>) is a key anabolic enzyme for de novo fatty acid synthesis, which is important in the development of colon carcinoma.
The high expression of <mark>FASN</mark> is considered a promising molecular target for colon cancer therapy.
Emodin, a naturally occurring anthraquinone, exhibits an anticancer effect in various types of human cancer, including colon cancer; however, the molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.
Cell viability was evaluated using a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay.
The apoptosis rate of cells was quantified via flow cytometry following <mark>Annexin V</mark>/propidium iodide staining.
<mark>FASN</mark> activity was measured by monitoring oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate at a wavelength of 340 nm, and intracellular free fatty acid levels were detected using a Free Fatty Acid Quantification kit.
Western blot analysis and reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction were used to detect target gene and protein expression.
The present study was performed to investigate whether the gene expression of <mark>FASN</mark> and its enzymatic activity are regulated by emodin in a human colon cancer cell line.
Emodin markedly inhibited the proliferation of HCT116 cells and a higher protein level of <mark>FASN</mark> was expressed, compared with that in SW480, SNU-C2A or SNU‑C5 cells.
Emodin significantly downregulated the protein expression of <mark>FASN</mark> in HCT116 cells, which was caused by protein degradation due to elevated protein ubiquitination.
Emodin also inhibited intracellular <mark>FASN</mark> enzymatic activity and reduced the levels of intracellular free fatty acids.
Emodin enhanced antiproliferation and apoptosis in a dose‑ and time‑dependent manner.
The combined treatment of emodin and cerulenin, a commercial <mark>FASN</mark> inhibitor, had an additive effect on these activities.
Palmitate, the final product of the <mark>FASN</mark> reaction, rescued emodin‑induced viability and apoptosis.
In addition, emodin altered <mark>FASN</mark>‑involved signaling pathways, including <mark>phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> and <mark>mitogen<mark>mitogen‑activated protein kinases/extrace<mark>extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2</mark>.
These results suggested that emodin-regulated cell growth and apoptosis were mediated by inhibiting <mark>FASN</mark> and provide a molecular basis for colon cancer therapy.
<mark>Syndecan-1</mark> is a novel molecular marker for triple negative inflammatory breast cancer and modulates the cancer stem cell phenotype via the <mark>IL-6</mark>/<mark>STAT3</mark>, <mark>Notch</mark> and <mark>EGFR</mark> signaling pathways.
BACKGROUND: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), a particularly aggressive form of breast cancer, is characterized by cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype.
Due to a lack of targeted therapies, the identification of molecular markers of IBC is of major importance.
The <mark>heparan sulfate proteoglycan</mark> <mark>Syndecan-1</mark> acts as a coreceptor for growth factors and <mark>chemokines</mark>, modulating inflammation, tumor progression, and cancer stemness, thus it may emerge as a molecular marker for IBC.
METHODS: We characterized expression of <mark>Syndecan-1</mark> and the CSC marker <mark>CD44</mark>, <mark>Notch-1 & -3</mark> and <mark>EGFR</mark> in carcinoma tissues of triple negative IBC (n = 13) and non-IBC (n = 17) patients using qPCR and immunohistochemistry.
Impact of siRNA-mediated <mark>Syndecan-1</mark> knockdown on the CSC phenotype of the human triple negative IBC cell line SUM-149 and <mark>HER-2</mark>-overexpressing non-IBC SKBR3 cells employing qPCR, flow cytometry, Western blotting, secretome profiling and <mark>Notch</mark> pharmacological inhibition experiments.
Data were statistically analyzed using Student's t-test/Mann-Whitney U-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests.
RESULTS: Our data indicate upregulation and a significant positive correlation of <mark>Syndecan-1</mark> with <mark>CD44</mark> protein, and <mark>Notch-1 & -3</mark> and <mark>EGFR</mark> mRNA in IBC vs non-IBC.
<mark>ALDH1</mark> activity and the <mark>CD44</mark>((+))<mark>CD24</mark>((-/low)) subset as readout of a CSC phenotype were reduced upon <mark>Syndecan-1</mark> knockdown.
Functionally, <mark>Syndecan-1</mark> silencing significantly reduced 3D spheroid and colony formation.
Intriguingly, qPCR results indicate downregulation of the <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-8</mark>, <mark>CCL20</mark>, <mark>gp130</mark> and <mark>EGFR</mark> mRNA upon <mark>Syndecan-1</mark> suppression in both cell lines.
Moreover, <mark>Syndecan-1</mark> silencing significantly downregulated <mark>Notch-1, -3, -4</mark> and <mark>Hey-1</mark> in SUM-149 cells, and downregulated only <mark>Notch-3</mark> and <mark>Gli-1</mark> mRNA in SKBR3 cells.
Secretome profiling unveiled reduced <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-8</mark>, <mark>GRO-alpha</mark> and <mark>GRO a/b/g</mark> <mark>cytokines</mark> in conditioned media of <mark>Syndecan-1</mark> knockdown SUM-149 cells compared to controls.
The constitutively activated <mark>STAT3</mark> and NFκB, and expression of <mark>gp130</mark>, <mark>Notch-1 & -2</mark>, and <mark>EGFR</mark> proteins were suppressed upon <mark>Syndecan-1</mark> ablation.
Mechanistically, <mark>gamma-secretase</mark> inhibition experiments suggested that <mark>Syndecan-1</mark> may regulate the expression of <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-8</mark>, <mark>gp130</mark>, <mark>Hey-1</mark>, <mark>EGFR</mark> and <mark>p-Akt</mark> via <mark>Notch</mark> signaling.
CONCLUSIONS: <mark>Syndecan-1</mark> acts as a novel tissue biomarker and a modulator of CSC phenotype of triple negative IBC via the <mark>IL-6</mark>/<mark>STAT3</mark>, <mark>Notch</mark> and <mark>EGFR</mark> signaling pathways, thus emerging as a promising therapeutic target for IBC.
Endothelial <mark>HIF-1α</mark> Enables Hypothalamic Glucose Uptake to Drive <mark>POMC</mark> Neurons.
Glucose is the primary driver of hypothalamic <mark>proopiomelanocortin</mark> (<mark>POMC</mark>) neurons.
We show that endothelial <mark>hypoxia-inducible factor 1α</mark> (<mark>HIF-1α</mark>) controls glucose uptake in the hypothalamus and that it is upregulated in conditions of undernourishment, during which <mark>POMC</mark> neuronal activity is decreased.
Endothelium-specific knockdown of <mark>HIF-1α</mark> impairs the ability of <mark>POMC</mark> neurons to adapt to the changing metabolic environment in vivo, resulting in overeating after food deprivation in mice.
The impaired functioning of <mark>POMC</mark> neurons was reversed ex vivo or by parenchymal glucose administration.
These observations indicate an active role for endothelial cells in the central control of metabolism and suggest that central vascular impairments may cause metabolic disorders.
Folding of a single domain protein entering the endoplasmic reticulum precedes disulfide formation.
The relationship between protein synthesis, folding, and disulfide formation within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is poorly understood.
Previous studies have suggested that pre-existing disulfide links are absolutely required to allow protein folding and, conversely, that protein folding occurs prior to disulfide formation.
To address the question of what happens first within the ER, that is, protein folding or disulfide formation, we studied folding events at the early stages of polypeptide chain translocation into the mammalian ER using stalled translation intermediates.
Our results demonstrate that polypeptide folding can occur without complete domain translocation.
<mark>Protein disulfide isomerase</mark> (<mark>PDI</mark>) interacts with these early intermediates, but disulfide formation does not occur unless the entire sequence of the protein domain is translocated.
This is the first evidence that folding of the polypeptide chain precedes disulfide formation within a cellular context and highlights key differences between protein folding in the ER and refolding of purified proteins.
A team of heterochromatin factors collaborates with <mark>small RNA</mark> pathways to combat repetitive elements and germline stress.
Repetitive sequences derived from transposons make up a large fraction of eukaryotic genomes and must be silenced to protect genome integrity.
Repetitive elements are often found in heterochromatin; however, the roles and interactions of heterochromatin proteins in repeat regulation are poorly understood.
Here we show that a diverse set of C. elegans heterochromatin proteins act together with the <mark>piRNA</mark> and <mark>nuclear RNAi</mark> pathways to silence repetitive elements and prevent genotoxic stress in the germ line.
Mutants in genes encoding <mark>HPL-2</mark>/<mark>HP1</mark>, <mark>LIN-13</mark>, <mark>LIN-61</mark>, <mark>LET-418</mark>/<mark>Mi-2</mark>, and H3K9me2 <mark>histone methyltransferase MET-2</<mark>MET-2</mark>/<mark>SETDB1</mark> also show functionally redundant sterility, increased germline apoptosis, DNA repair defects, and interactions with <mark>small RNA</mark> pathways.
Remarkably, fertility of heterochromatin mutants could be partially restored by inhibiting <mark>cep-1</mark>/<mark>p53</mark>, endogenous meiotic double strand breaks, or the expression of MIRAGE1 DNA transposons.
Functional redundancy among factors and pathways underlies the importance of safeguarding the genome through multiple means.
<mark>CD38</mark> promotes <mark>angiotensin II</mark>-induced cardiac hypertrophy.
Cardiac hypertrophy is an early hallmark during the clinical course of heart failure and regulated by various signalling pathways.
Recently, we observed that mouse embryonic fibroblasts from <mark>CD38</mark> knockout mice were significantly resistant to oxidative stress such as H2 O2 -induced injury and hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced injury.
In addition, we also found that <mark>CD38</mark> knockout mice protected heart from ischaemia reperfusion injury through activating <mark>SIRT1</mark>/<mark>FOXO</mark>s-mediated antioxidative stress pathway.
However, the role of <mark>CD38</mark> in cardiac hypertrophy is not explored.
Here, we investigated the roles and mechanisms of <mark>CD38</mark> in <mark>angiotensin II</mark> (<mark>Ang-II</mark>)-induced cardiac hypertrophy.
Following 14 days of <mark>Ang-II</mark> infusion with osmotic mini-pumps, a comparable hypertension was generated in both of <mark>CD38</mark> knockout and wild-type mice.
However, the cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis were much more severe in wild-type mice compared with <mark>CD38</mark> knockout mice.
Consistently, RNAi-induced knockdown of <mark>CD38</mark> decreased the gene expressions of <mark>atrial natriuretic factor</mark> (<mark>ANF</mark>) and <mark>brain natriuretic peptide</mark> (<mark>BNP</mark>) and reactive oxygen species generation in <mark>Ang-II</mark>-stimulated H9c2 cells.
In addition, the expression of <mark>SIRT3</mark> was elevated in <mark>CD38</mark> knockdown H9c2 cells, in which <mark>SIRT3</mark> may further activate the <mark>FOXO3</mark> antioxidant pathway.
The intracellular Ca(2+) release induced by <mark>Ang-II</mark> markedly decreased in <mark>CD38</mark> knockdown H9c2 cells, which might be associated with the decrease of nuclear translocation of <mark>NFATc4</mark> and inhibition of <mark>ERK</mark>/<mark>AKT</mark> phosphorylation.
We concluded that <mark>CD38</mark> plays an essential role in cardiac hypertrophy probably via inhibition of <mark>SIRT3</mark> expression and activation of Ca(2+) -<mark>NFAT</mark> signalling pathway.
Thus, <mark>CD38</mark> may be a novel target for treating cardiac hypertrophy.
<mark>Geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase</mark> inhibition induces apoptosis that is dependent upon GGPP depletion, <mark>ERK</mark> phosphorylation and <mark>caspase</mark> activation.
Bisphosphonates are diphosphate analogs that inhibit the intermediate enzymes of the mevalonate pathway.
Here, we compared the effects of a <mark>farnesyl diphosphate synthase</mark> inhibitor, zoledronate, and a <mark>geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase</mark> (<mark>GGDPS</mark>) inhibitor, digeranyl bisphosphonate (DGBP), on lymphocytic leukemia cell proliferation and apoptosis.
Both zoledronate and DGBP inhibited proliferation with DGBP doing so more potently.
DGBP was markedly less toxic than zoledronate toward the viability of healthy human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
Addition of GGPP, but not farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), prevented the anti-proliferative effects of DGBP.
Both GGPP and FPP partially rescued the effects of zoledronate.
Co-treatment with DGBP and zoledronate was antagonistic.
To further assess the effects of the bisphosphonates, we analyzed <mark>annexin V</mark> and propidium iodide staining via flow cytometry and found that DGBP induced apoptosis more potently than zoledronate.
Western blots show that DGBP treatment altered expression and membrane affinity of some but not all geranylgeranylated <mark>small GTPases</mark>, activated <mark>caspases</mark> and increased <mark>ERK</mark> phosphorylation.
Importantly, the anti-proliferative effects of DGBP were blocked by treatment with a <mark>caspase</mark> inhibitor and by treatment with a <mark>MEK</mark> inhibitor.
Together, our findings indicate that DGBP is a more potent and selective compound than zoledronate in inducing apoptosis mediated through pathways that include <mark>caspases</mark> and <mark>MEK</mark>/<mark>ERK</mark>.
These findings support the further development of <mark>GGDPS</mark> inhibitors as anticancer therapeutics.
Arabidopsis <mark>RETINOBLASTOMA RELATED</mark> directly regulates DNA damage responses through functions beyond cell cycle control.
The rapidly proliferating cells in plant meristems must be protected from genome damage.
Here, we show that the regulatory role of the Arabidopsis <mark>RETINOBLASTOMA RELATED</mark> (<mark>RBR</mark>) in cell proliferation can be separated from a novel function in safeguarding genome integrity.
Upon DNA damage, <mark>RBR</mark> and its binding partner <mark>E2FA</mark> are recruited to heterochromatic γH2AX-labelled DNA damage foci in an <mark>ATM</mark>- and <mark>ATR</mark>-dependent manner.
These γH2AX-labelled DNA lesions are more dispersedly occupied by the conserved repair protein, <mark>AtBRCA1</mark>, which can also co-localise with <mark>RBR</mark> foci.
<mark>RBR</mark> and <mark>AtBRCA1</mark> physically interact in vitro and in planta Genetic interaction between the <mark>RBR</mark>-silenced ami<mark>RBR</mark> and <mark>Atbrca1</mark> mutants suggests that <mark>RBR</mark> and <mark>AtBRCA1</mark> may function together in maintaining genome integrity.
Together with <mark>E2FA</mark>, <mark>RBR</mark> is directly involved in the transcriptional DNA damage response as well as in the cell death pathway that is independent of <mark>SOG1</mark>, the plant functional analogue of <mark>p53</mark>.
Thus, plant homologs and analogues of major mammalian <mark>tumour suppressor proteins</mark> form a regulatory network that coordinates cell proliferation with cell and genome integrity.
Androgen Stimulates Growth of Mouse Preantral Follicles In Vitro: Interaction With <mark>Follicle-Stimulating Hormone</mark> and With Growth Factors of the <mark>TGFβ Superfamily</mark>.
Androgens are essential for the normal function of mature antral follicles but also have a role in the early stages of follicle development.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common cause of anovulatory infertility, is characterized by androgen excess and aberrant follicle development that includes accelerated early follicle growth.
We have examined the effects of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on development of isolated mouse preantral follicles in culture with the specific aim of investigating interaction with <mark>follicle-stimulating hormone</mark> (<mark>FSH</mark>), the steroidogenic pathway, and growth factors of the <mark>TGFβ superfamily</mark> that are known to have a role in early follicle development.
Both testosterone and DHT stimulated follicle growth and augmented <mark>FSH</mark>-induced growth and increased the incidence of antrum formation among the granulosa cell layers of these preantral follicles after 72 hours in culture.
Effects of both androgens were reversed by the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide.
<mark>FSH receptor</mark> expression was increased in response to both testosterone and DHT, as was that of <mark>Star</mark>, whereas <mark>Cyp11a1</mark> was down-regulated.
The key androgen-induced changes in the <mark>TGFβ</mark> signaling pathway were down-regulation of <mark>Amh, Bm<mark>Amh</mark>, <mark>Bmp15</mark>heir recepto<mark>receptors</mark>.
Inhibition of <mark>Alk6</mark> (<mark>Bmpr1b</mark>), a putative partner for <mark>Amhr2</mark> and <mark>Bmpr2</mark>, by dorsomorphin resulted in augmentation of androgen-stimulated growth and modification of androgen-induced gene expression.
Our findings point to varied effects of androgen on preantral follicle growth and function, including interaction with <mark>FSH</mark>-activated growth and steroidogenesis, and, importantly, implicate the intrafollicular <mark>TGFβ</mark> system as a key mediator of androgen action.
These findings provide insight into abnormal early follicle development in PCOS.
The <mark>mTOR</mark> signal regulates myeloid-derived suppressor cells differentiation and immunosuppressive function in acute kidney injury.
The <mark>mammalian target of rapamycin</mark> (<mark>mTOR</mark>) signal controls innate and adaptive immune response in multiple immunoregulatory contexts.
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of myeloid cells of potent immunosuppressive capacity.
In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of MDSCs in the protection of acute kidney injury (AKI) and the regulation of <mark>mTOR</mark> signal on MDSC's protective role in this context.
In mice AKI model, rapamycin administration was associated with improved renal function, restored histological damage and decreased <mark>CD4</mark>(+) and <mark>CD8</mark>(+) T-cell infiltration in kidney tissue.
MDSCs, especially <mark>CD11b</mark>(+)<mark>Ly6G</mark>(+)<mark>Ly6C</mark>(low) G-MDSCs were recruited to the injured kidney following the interaction of <mark>CXCL1</mark>, <mark>CXCL2</mark> and their receptor <mark>CXCR2</mark> after inhibiting <mark>mTOR</mark> signal with rapamycin treatment.
The adoptive transfer of rapamycin-treated MDSCs into the mice with AKI significantly improved the renal function, ameliorated histologic damages and limited the infiltration of T cells in kidney tissue.
In addition, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines <mark>IL-1b</mark> and <mark>IFN-g</mark> mRNA was downregulated while the expression of <mark>TGF-b1</mark> and <mark>Foxp3</mark> mRNA was upregulated in kidney tissue after transferring rapamycin-treated MDSCs.
Adoptive transfer of rapamycin-treated MDSCs also downregulated the serum levels of <mark>IL-1b</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark> and <mark>IFN-g</mark> and upregulated the serum levels of <mark>TGF-b1</mark> compared with the IR group and PBS-treated MDSC group.
In in vitro study, inhibiting <mark>mTOR</mark> signal regulated the induction of MDSC towards the <mark>CD11b</mark>(+)<mark>Ly6G</mark>(+)<mark>Ly6C</mark>(low) G-MDSC subset.
The ability to suppress T-cell proliferation of both bone marrow-derived <mark>CD11b</mark>(+)<mark>Ly6G</mark>(+)<mark>Ly6C</mark>(low) G-MDSCs and <mark>CD11b</mark>(+)<mark>Ly6G</mark>(-)<mark>Ly6C</mark>(high) M-MDSCs was enhanced by <mark>mTOR</mark> signal inhibition via upregulating the expression of <mark>Arginase-1</mark> and <mark>iNOS</mark>.
Accordingly, both G-MDSCs and M-MDSCs presented downregulated <mark>runx1</mark> gene expression after rapamycin treatment.
Taken together, our results demonstrated that MDSCs ameliorated AKI and the protective effect was enhanced by <mark>mTOR</mark> signal inhibition via promoting MDSCs recruitment, regulating the induction of MDSCs and strengthening their immunosuppressive activity.
GWAS identifies population-specific new regulatory variants in <mark>FUT6</mark> associated with plasma B12 concentrations in Indians.
Vitamin B12 is an important cofactor in one-carbon metabolism whose dysregulation is associated with various clinical conditions.
Indians have a high prevalence of B12 deficiency but little is known about the genetic determinants of circulating B12 concentrations in Indians.
We performed a genome-wide association study in 1001 healthy participants in the Pune Maternal Nutrition Study (PMNS), replication studies in 3418 individuals from other Indian cohorts and by meta-analysis identified new variants, rs3760775 (P = 1.2 × 10-23) and rs78060698 (P = 8.3 × 10-17) in <mark>FUT6</mark> to be associated with circulating B12 concentrations.
Although in-silico analysis replicated both variants in Europeans, differences in the effect allele frequency, effect size and the linkage disequilibrium structure of credible set variants with the reported variants suggest population-specific characteristics in this region.
We replicated previously reported variants rs602662, rs601338 in <mark>FUT2</mark>, rs3760776, rs708686 in <mark>FUT6</mark>, rs34324219 in <mark>TCN1</mark> (all P < 5 × 10-8), rs1131603 in <mark>TCN2</mark> (P = 3.4 × 10-5), rs12780845 in CUBN (P = 3.0 × 10-3) and rs2270655 in <mark>MMAA</mark> (P = 2.0 × 10-3).
Circulating B12 concentrations in the PMNS and Parthenon study showed a significant decline with increasing age (P < 0.001), however, the genetic contribution to B12 concentrations remained constant.
Luciferase reporter and electrophoretic-mobility shift assay for the <mark>FUT6</mark> variant rs78060698 using HepG2 cell line demonstrated strong allele-specific promoter and enhancer activity and differential binding of <mark>HNF4α</mark>, a key regulator of expression of various <mark>fucosyltransferases</mark>.
Hence, the rs78060698 variant, through regulation of fucosylation may control intestinal host-microbial interaction which could influence B12 concentrations.
Our results suggest that in addition to established genetic variants, population-specific variants are important in determining plasma B12 concentrations.
<mark>AGR2</mark> ameliorates <mark>tumor necrosis factor-α</mark>-induced epithelial barrier dysfunction via suppression of <mark>NF-κB p65</mark>-mediated <mark>MLCK</mark>/p-<mark>MLC</mark> pathway activation.
Intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
<mark>Anterior gradient protein 2 homologue</mark> (<mark>AGR2</mark>) assists in maintaining intestinal homeostasis in dextran sulphate sodium-induced mouse ileocolitis; however, it is unclear whether it modulates intestinal barrier function.
Our study aimed to investigate the protective role of <mark>AGR2</mark> in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced intestinal epithelial barrier injury.
Caco-2 cell monolayers were pre-transfected with an <mark>AGR2</mark> plasmid and then exposed to TNF-α.
Epithelial permeability was assessed by detecting transepithelial electrical resistance and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (40 kDa) flux.
The protein expression levels of <mark>zonula occludens-1</mark> (<mark>ZO-1</mark>), <mark>occludin</mark>, <mark>claudin-1</mark>, <mark>myosin light chain kinase</mark> (<mark>MLCK</mark>)/p-<mark>MLC</mark>, and <mark>nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65</mark> were determined by western blotting.
In addition, the cellular distributions of <mark>ZO-1</mark>, <mark>occludin</mark>, <mark>F-actin</mark>, and <mark>NF-κB p65</mark> were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining.
The results showed that the <mark>AGR2</mark> mRNA and protein expression levels were both decreased in the Caco-2 cell monolayers, while <mark>AGR2</mark> overexpression significantly ameliorated TNF-α-induced epithelial barrier hyperpermeability, increased the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins and stabilized the cytoskeletal structure.
Furthermore, <mark>AGR2</mark> inhibited the changes in <mark>MLCK</mark>, <mark>MLC</mark> and p-<mark>MLC</mark> expression in response to TNF-α stimulation.
Collectively, our study suggests that <mark>AGR2</mark> inhibits TNF-α‑induced Caco-2 cell hyperpermeability by regulating TJ and that this protective mechanism may be promoted by inhibition of <mark>NF-κB p65</mark>-mediated activation of the <mark>MLCK</mark>/p-<mark>MLC</mark> signaling pathway.
<mark>Skp2</mark> deficiency restricts the progression and stem cell features of castration-resistant prostate cancer by destabilizing <mark>Twist</mark>.
Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains a major clinical challenge because of the lack of effective targeted therapy for its treatment.
The mechanism underlying how CRPC gains resistance toward hormone depletion and other forms of chemotherapy is poorly understood.
Research on understanding the factors that drive these processes is desperately needed to generate new therapies to cure the disease.
Here, we discovered a fundamental role of <mark>S-phase protein kinase 2</mark> (<mark>Skp2</mark>) in the formation and progression of CRPC.
In transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate model, <mark>Skp2</mark> depletion leads to a profound repression of prostate tumor growth and distal metastasis and substantially prolonged overall survival.
We revealed that <mark>Skp2</mark> regulates CRPC through <mark>Twist</mark>-mediated oncogenic functions including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC) acquisitions.
Mechanistically, <mark>Skp2</mark> interacted with <mark>Twist</mark> and promoted the non-degradative ubiquitination of <mark>Twist</mark>.
Consequently, <mark>Skp2</mark> stabilized <mark>Twist</mark> protein expression by preventing proteasomal degradation of <mark>Twist</mark> by <mark>β-TrCP</mark>.
We found that <mark>Twist</mark> overexpression augments CSC self-renewal and population and that <mark>Skp2</mark> inhibition reverts <mark>Twist</mark>'s effects on CSC regulation.
Furthermore, genetically depleting or pharmacologically inactivating <mark>Skp2</mark> synergistically re-sensitized CRPC cells toward chemotherapies such as paclitaxel or doxorubicin.
Together, this study uncovering <mark>Skp2</mark>-mediated <mark>Twist</mark> stabilization and oncogenic functions in CRPC offers new knowledge on how CRPC progresses and acquires chemoresistance during tumor progression.
It provides proof of principle that <mark>Skp2</mark> targeting is a promising approach to combat metastatic CRPC by targeting <mark>Twist</mark> and CSCs.
Selective Targeting of SH2 Domain-Phosphotyrosine Interactions of <mark>Src Family Tyrosine Kinases</mark> with Monobodies.
The binding of <mark>Src</mark>-homology 2 (SH2) domains to phosphotyrosine (pY) sites is critical for the autoinhibition and substrate recognition of the eight <mark>Src family kinases</mark> (<mark>SFKs</mark>).
The high sequence conservation of the 120 human SH2 domains poses a significant challenge to selectively perturb the interactions of even the <mark>SFK</mark> SH2 family against the rest of the SH2 domains.
We have developed synthetic binding proteins, termed monobodies, for six of the <mark>SFK</mark> SH2 domains with nanomolar affinity.
Most of these monobodies competed with pY ligand binding and showed strong selectivity for either the <mark>SrcA</mark> (<mark>Yes</mark>, <mark>Src</mark>, <mark>Fyn</mark>, <mark>Fgr</mark>) or <mark>SrcB</mark> subgroup (<mark>Lck</mark>, <mark>Lyn</mark>, <mark>Blk</mark>, <mark>Hck</mark>).
Interactome analysis of intracellularly expressed monobodies revealed that they bind <mark>SFKs</mark> but no other SH2-containing proteins.
Three crystal structures of monobody-SH2 complexes unveiled different and only partly overlapping binding modes, which rationalized the observed selectivity and enabled structure-based mutagenesis to modulate inhibition mode and selectivity.
In line with the critical roles of <mark>SFK</mark> SH2 domains in kinase autoinhibition and <mark>T-cell receptor</mark> signaling, monobodies binding the <mark>Src</mark> and <mark>Hck</mark> SH2 domains selectively activated respective recombinant <mark>kinases</mark>, whereas an <mark>Lck</mark> SH2-binding monobody inhibited proximal signaling events downstream of the <mark>T-cell receptor</mark> complex.
Our results show that <mark>SFK</mark> SH2 domains can be targeted with unprecedented potency and selectivity using monobodies.
They are excellent tools for dissecting <mark>SFK</mark> functions in normal development and signaling and to interfere with aberrant <mark>SFK</mark> signaling networks in cancer cells.
<mark>FGFR2</mark> is required for airway basal cell self-renewal and terminal differentiation.
Airway stem cells slowly self-renew and produce differentiated progeny to maintain homeostasis throughout the lifespan of an individual.
Mutations in the molecular regulators of these processes may drive cancer or degenerative disease, but are also potential therapeutic targets.
Conditionally deleting one copy of <mark>FGF receptor 2</mark> (<mark>FGFR2</mark>) in adult mouse airway basal cells results in self-renewal and differentiation phenotypes.
We show that <mark>FGFR2</mark> signalling correlates with maintenance of expression of a key transcription factor for basal cell self-renewal and differentiation: <mark>SOX2</mark>.
This heterozygous phenotype illustrates that subtle changes in <mark>receptor tyrosine kinase</mark> signalling can have significant effects, perhaps providing an explanation for the numerous changes seen in cancer.
Dual role for <mark>Jumu</mark> in the control of hematopoietic progenitors in the Drosophila lymph gland.
The Drosophila lymph gland is a hematopoietic organ in which the maintenance of hematopoietic progenitor cell fate relies on intrinsic factors and extensive interaction with cells within a microenvironment.
The posterior signaling center (PSC) is required for maintaining the balance between progenitors and their differentiation into mature hemocytes.
Moreover, some factors from the progenitors cell-autonomously control blood cell differentiation.
Here, we show that <mark>Jumeau</mark> (<mark>Jumu</mark>), a member of the <mark>forkhead (Fkh) transcription factor</mark> family, controls hemocyte differentiation of lymph gland through multiple regulatory mechanisms.
<mark>Jumu</mark> maintains the proper differentiation of prohemocytes by cell-autonomously regulating the expression of <mark>Col</mark> in medullary zone and by non-cell-autonomously preventing the generation of expanded PSC cells.
<mark>Jumu</mark> can also cell-autonomously control the proliferation of PSC cells through positive regulation of <mark>dMyc</mark> expression.
We also show that a deficiency of <mark>jumu</mark> throughout the lymph gland can induce the differentiation of lamellocytes via activating <mark>Toll</mark> signaling.
Hydrogen Peroxide Triggers a Dual Signaling Axis To Selectively Suppress Activated Human T Lymphocyte Migration.
H2O2 is an early danger cue required for innate immune cell recruitment to wounds.
To date, little is known about whether H2O2 is required for the migration of human adaptive immune cells to sites of inflammation.
However, oxidative stress is known to impair T cell activity, induce actin stiffness, and inhibit cell polarization.
In this study, we show that low oxidative concentrations of H2O2 also impede chemokinesis and chemotaxis of previously activated human T cells to <mark>CXCL11</mark>, but not <mark>CXCL10</mark> or <mark>CXCL12</mark>.
We show that this deficiency in migration is due to a reduction in inflammatory <mark>chemokine receptor</mark> <mark>CXCR3</mark> surface expression and cellular activation of <mark>lipid phosphatase</mark> <mark>SHIP-1</mark>.
We demonstrate that H2O2 acts through an <mark>Src kinase</mark> to activate a negative regulator of <mark>PI3K</mark> signaling, <mark>SHIP-1</mark> via phosphorylation, providing a molecular mechanism for H2O2-induced chemotaxis deficiency.
We hypothesize that although H2O2 serves as an early recruitment trigger for innate immune cells, it appears to operate as an inhibitor of T lymphocyte immune adaptive responses that are not required until later in the repair process.
Evaluation of pancreatic cancer cell migration with multiple parameters in vitro by using an optical real-time cell mobility assay device.
BACKGROUND: Migration of cancer cell correlates with distant metastasis and local invasion, which are good targets for cancer treatment.
An optically accessible device "TAXIScan" was developed, which provides considerably more information regarding the cellular dynamics and less quantity of samples than do the existing methods.
Here, we report the establishment of a system to analyze the nature of pancreatic cancer cells using TAXIScan and we evaluated lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-elicited pancreatic cell migration.
METHODS: Pancreatic cancer cell lines, BxPC3, PANC-1, AsPC1, and MIAPaCa-2, were analyzed for adhesion as well as migration towards LPA by TAXIScan using parameters such as velocity and directionality or for the number of migrated cells by the Boyden chamber methods.
To confirm that the migration was initiated by LPA, the expression of <mark>LPA receptors</mark> and activation of intracellular signal transductions were examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase reaction and western blotting.
RESULTS: Scaffold coating was necessary for the adhesion of pancreatic cancer cells, and collagen I and Matrigel were found to be good scaffolds.
BxPC3 and PANC-1 cells clearly migrated towards the concentration gradient formed by injecting 1 μL LPA, which was abrogated by pre-treatment with LPA inhibitor, Ki16425 (IC50 for the directionality ≈ 1.86 μM).
The LPA dependent migration was further confirmed by mRNA and protein expression of <mark>LPA receptors</mark> as well as phosphorylation of signaling molecules.
<mark>LPA1</mark> mRNA was highest among the 6 receptors, and <mark>LPA1</mark>, <mark>LPA2</mark> and <mark>LPA3</mark> proteins were detected in BxPC3 and PANC-1 cells.
Phosphorylation of <mark>Akt</mark> (Thr308 and Ser473) and <mark>p42</ma<mark>p42/44MAPK<<mark>44MAPK</mark> in BxPC3 and PANC-1 cells was observed after LPA stimulation, which was clearly inhibited by pre-treatment with a compound Ki16425.
CONCLUSIONS: We established a novel pancreatic cancer cell migration assay system using TAXIScan.
This assay device provides multiple information on migrating cells simultaneously, such as their morphology, directionality, and velocity, with a small volume of sample and can be a powerful tool for analyzing the nature of cancer cells and for identifying new factors that affect cell functions.
<mark>Paxillin</mark> and <mark>embryonic PolyAdenylation Binding Protein</mark> (<mark>ePABP</mark>) engage to regulate androgen-dependent Xenopus laevis oocyte maturation - A model of <mark>kinase</mark>-dependent regulation of protein expression.
Steroid-triggered Xenopus laevis oocyte maturation is an elegant physiologic model of nongenomic steroid signaling, as it proceeds completely independent of transcription.
We previously demonstrated that androgens are the main physiologic stimulator of oocyte maturation in Xenopus oocytes, and that the <mark>adaptor protein</mark> <mark>paxillin</mark> plays a crucial role in mediating this process through a positive feedback loop in which <mark>paxillin</mark> first enhances <mark>Mos</mark> protein translation, ensued by <mark>Erk2</mark> activation and <mark>Erk</mark>-dependent phosphorylation of <mark>paxillin</mark> on serine residues.
Phosphoserine-<mark>paxillin</mark> then further augments <mark>Mos</mark> protein translation and downstream <mark>Erk2</mark> activation, resulting in meiotic progression.
We hypothesized that <mark>paxillin</mark> enhances <mark>Mos</mark> translation by interacting with <mark>embryonic PolyAdenylation Binding Protein</mark> (<mark>ePABP</mark>) on polyadenylated <mark>Mos</mark> mRNA.
Knockdown of <mark>ePABP</mark> phenocopied <mark>paxillin</mark> knockdown, with reduced <mark>Mos</mark> protein expression, <mark>Erk2</mark> and <mark>Cdk1</mark> activation, as well as oocyte maturation.
In both Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells (HEK-293), <mark>paxillin</mark> and <mark>ePABP</mark> constitutively interacted.
Testosterone (Xenopus) or <mark>EGF</mark> (HEK-293) augmented <mark>ePABP</mark>-<mark>paxillin</mark> binding, as well as <mark>ePABP</mark> binding to <mark>Mos</mark> mRNA (Xenopus), in an <mark>Erk</mark>-dependent fashion.
Thus, <mark>ePABP</mark> and <mark>paxillin</mark> work together in an <mark>Erk</mark>-dependent fashion to enhance <mark>Mos</mark> protein translation and promote oocyte maturation.
<mark>HBEGF</mark> promotes gliomagenesis in the context of <mark>Ink4a/Arf</mark> and <mark>Pten</mark> loss.
<mark>Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factor</mark> (<mark>HBEGF</mark>) is a ligand for the <mark>EGF receptor</mark> (<mark>EGFR</mark>), one of the most commonly amplified <mark>receptor tyrosine kinases</mark> (<mark>RTKs</mark>) in glioblastoma (GBM).
While <mark>HBEGF</mark> has been found to be expressed in a subset of malignant gliomas, its sufficiency for glioma initiation has not been evaluated.
In this study, we demonstrate that <mark>HBEGF</mark> can initiate GBM in mice in the context of <mark>Ink4a/Arf</mark> and <mark>Pten</mark> loss, and that these tumors are similar to the classical GBM subtype observed in patients.
Isogenic astrocytes from these mice showed activation not only of <mark>Egfr</mark> but also the <mark>RTK</mark> <mark>Axl</mark> in response to <mark>HBEGF</mark> stimulation.
Deletion of either <mark>Egfr</mark> or <mark>Axl</mark> decreased the tumorigenic properties of <mark>HBEGF</mark>-transformed cells; however, only <mark>EGFR</mark> was able to rescue the phenotype in cells lacking both <mark>RTKs</mark> indicating that <mark>Egfr</mark> is required for activation of <mark>Axl</mark> in this context.
Silencing of <mark>HBEGF</mark> in vivo resulted in tumor regression and significantly increased survival, suggesting that <mark>HBEGF</mark> may be a clinically relevant target.
<mark>Myc</mark> enhances <mark>B-cell receptor</mark> signaling in precancerous B cells and confers resistance to <mark>Btk</mark> inhibition.
Dysregulation of the oncogenic transcription factor <mark>MYC</mark> induces B-cell transformation and is a driver for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL).
<mark>MYC</mark> overexpression in B-NHL is associated with more aggressive phenotypes and poor prognosis.
Although genomic studies suggest a link between <mark>MYC</mark> overexpression and <mark>B-cell receptor</mark> (<mark>BCR</mark>) signaling molecules in B-NHL, signaling pathways essential to <mark>Myc</mark>-mediated B-cell transformation have not been fully elucidated.
We utilized intracellular phospho-flow cytometry to investigate the relationship between <mark>Myc</mark> and <mark>BCR</mark> signaling in pre-malignant B cells.
Utilizing the Eμ-<mark>myc</mark> mouse model, where <mark>Myc</mark> is overexpressed specifically in B cells, both basal and stimulated <mark>BCR</mark> signaling were increased in precancerous B lymphocytes from Eμ-<mark>myc</mark> mice compared with wild-type littermates.
B cells overexpressing <mark>Myc</mark> displayed constitutively higher levels of activated <mark>CD79α</mark>, <mark>Btk</mark>, <mark>Plcγ2</mark> and <mark>Erk1/2</mark>.
Notably, <mark>Myc</mark>-overexpressing B cells maintained elevated <mark>BCR</mark> signaling despite treatment with ibrutinib, a <mark>Bruton's tyrosine kinase</mark> inhibitor.
Furthermore, <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> pathway signaling was also increased in Eμ-<mark>myc</mark> B cells, and this increase was partially suppressed with ibrutinib.
In addition, experiments with <mark>Btk</mark>-null B cells revealed off-target effects of ibrutinib on BCR signaling.
Our data show that in pre-malignant B cells, <mark>Myc</mark> overexpression is sufficient to activate <mark>BCR</mark> and <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> signaling pathways and further enhances signaling following BCR ligation.
Therefore, our results indicate that precancerous B cells have already acquired enhanced survival and growth capabilities before transformation, and that elevated <mark>MYC</mark> levels confer resistance to pharmacologic inhibitors of <mark>BCR</mark> signaling, which has significant implications for B-NHL treatment.
Klinefelter syndrome comorbidities linked to increased X chromosome gene dosage and altered protein interactome activity.
Klinefelter syndrome (KS) (47,XXY) is the most common male sex chromosome aneuploidy.
Diagnosis and clinical supervision remain a challenge due to varying phenotypic presentation and insufficient characterization of the syndrome.
Here we combine health data-driven epidemiology and molecular level systems biology to improve the understanding of KS and the molecular interplay influencing its comorbidities.
In total, 78 overrepresented KS comorbidities were identified using in- and out-patient registry data from the entire Danish population covering 6.8 million individuals.
The comorbidities extracted included both clinically well-known (e.g. infertility and osteoporosis) and still less established KS comorbidities (e.g. pituitary gland hypofunction and dental caries).
Several systems biology approaches were applied to identify key molecular players underlying KS comorbidities: Identification of co-expressed modules as well as central hubs and gene dosage perturbed protein complexes in a KS comorbidity network build from known disease proteins and their protein-protein interactions.
The systems biology approaches together pointed to novel aspects of KS disease phenotypes including perturbed <mark>Jak</mark>-<mark>STAT</mark> pathway, dysregulated genes important for disturbed immune system (<mark>IL4</mark>), energy balance (<mark>POMC</mark> and <mark>LEP</mark>) and <mark>erythropoietin</mark> signalling in KS.
We present an extended epidemiological study that links KS comorbidities to the molecular level and identify potential causal players in the disease biology underlying the identified comorbidities.
Searching for biomarkers of <mark>CDKL5</mark> disorder: early-onset visual impairment in <mark>CDKL5</mark> mutant mice.
<mark>CDKL5</mark> disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder still without a cure.
Murine models of <mark>CDKL5</mark> disorder have been recently generated raising the possibility of preclinical testing of treatments.
However, unbiased, quantitative biomarkers of high translational value to monitor brain function are still missing.
Moreover, the analysis of treatment is hindered by the challenge of repeatedly and non-invasively testing neuronal function.
We analyzed the development of visual responses in a mouse model of <mark>CDKL5</mark> disorder to introduce visually evoked responses as a quantitative method to assess cortical circuit function.
Cortical visual responses were assessed in <mark>CDKL5</mark> null male mice, heterozygous females, and their respective control wild-type littermates by repeated transcranial optical imaging from P27 until P32.
No difference between wild-type and mutant mice was present at P25-P26 whereas defective responses appeared from P27-P28 both in heterozygous and homozygous <mark>CDKL5</mark> mutant mice.
These results were confirmed by visually evoked potentials (VEPs) recorded from the visual cortex of a different cohort.
The previously imaged mice were also analyzed at P60-80 using VEPs, revealing a persistent reduction of response amplitude, reduced visual acuity and defective contrast function.
The level of adult impairment was significantly correlated with the reduction in visual responses observed during development.
Support vector machine showed that multi-dimensional visual assessment can be used to automatically classify mutant and wt mice with high reliability.
Thus, monitoring visual responses represents a promising biomarker for preclinical and clinical studies on <mark>CDKL5</mark> disorder.
Downregulation of <mark>Talin1</mark> promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression through activation of the <mark>ERK1/2</mark> pathway.
<mark>Talin1</mark> is an adaptor protein that conjugates integrins to the cytoskeleton and regulates <mark>integrins</mark> and focal adhesion signaling.
Several studies have found that <mark>Talin1</mark> is overexpressed in several tumor types and promotes tumor progression.
However, the explicit role of <mark>Talin1</mark> in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression is still unclear and its functional mechanism remains largely unknown.
In this study, we showed a trend of gradually decreasing expression of <mark>Talin1</mark> from normal liver tissues to hepatocirrhosis, liver hyperplasia, the corresponding adjacent non-tumor, primary HCC, and eventually metastatic foci, indicating that <mark>Talin1</mark> may correlate with HCC initiation to progression.
<mark>Talin1</mark> was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues and low <mark>Talin1</mark> expression was associated with HCC progression and poor prognosis.
Furthermore, <mark>Talin1</mark> knockdown induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promoted migration and invasion in SK-Hep-1 cells and HepG2 cells.
Mechanistically, we found that the <mark>ERK</mark> pathway was responsible for these promoting effects of <mark>Talin1</mark> knockdown in HCC cells.
The promoting effects of <mark>Talin1</mark> knockdown on epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion were reversed by U0126, a specific <mark>ERK1/2</mark> inhibitor.
Taken together, our results suggested that <mark>Talin1</mark> might serve as a tumor suppressor in HCC and a potential prognostic biomarker for HCC patients.
Serum <mark>HOTAIR</mark> as a novel diagnostic biomarker for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an important issue to improve the prognosis.
<mark>HOX transcript antisense RNA</mark> (<mark>HOTAIR</mark>), a <mark>long noncoding RNA</mark> (<mark>lncRNA</mark>) expressed from the <mark>HOXC</mark> locus, has been recently revealed as an oncogenic regulator in ESCC.
This study aimed to investigate whether serum <mark>HOTAIR</mark> is involved in the diagnosis of ESCC.
METHODS: In this study, we detected serum <mark>HOTAIR</mark> expression in 50 patients with ESCC (including 42 tumor resection and 8 without surgery) and 20 healthy volunteers to investigate the role of serum <mark>HOTAIR</mark> in ESCC using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) method.
RESULTS: Clinical data indicated that serum <mark>HOTAIR</mark> were correlated with TNM stage.
The expression level of serum <mark>HOTAIR</mark> (0.189 ± 0.010) was significantly higher in ESCC patients compared with that of healthy controls (0.055 ± 0.008, P < 0.01).
The ROC curve analysis yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.793 (95% CI: 0.692 to 0.895, P < 0.01).
Also, the serum <mark>HOTAIR</mark> expression level decreased obviously in postoperative samples (one month after the surgery) compared to preoperative specimens.
Moreover, there was a significant correlation between serum <mark>HOTAIR</mark> expression and the expression of <mark>HOTAIR</mark> in ESCC tissue according to Pearson correlation analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study, for the first time, demonstrated that serum <mark>HOTAIR</mark> might serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of ESCC.
A heptameric peptide purified from Spirulina sp. gastrointestinal hydrolysate inhibits <mark>angiotensin I-converting enzyme</mark>- and <mark>angiotensin II</mark>-induced vascular dysfunction in human endothelial cells.
In this study, a marine microalga Spirulina sp.-derived protein was hydrolyzed using gastrointestinal enzymes to produce an <mark>angiotensin I (Ang I)-converting enzyme</mark> (<mark>ACE</mark>) inhibitory peptide.
Following consecutive purification, the potent <mark>ACE</mark> inhibitory peptide was composed of 7 amino acids, Thr-Met‑Glu‑Pro‑Gly‑Lys-Pro (molecular weight, 759 Da).
Analysis using the Lineweaver-Burk plot and molecular modeling suggested that the purified peptide acted as a mixed non-competitive inhibitor of <mark>ACE</mark>.
The inhibitory effects of the peptide against the cellular production of vascular dysfunction-related factors induced by <mark>Ang II</mark> were also investigated.
In human endothelial cells, the <mark>Ang II</mark>-induced production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species was inhibited, and the expression of <mark>inducible nitric oxide synthase</mark> (<mark>iNOS</mark>) and <mark>endothelin-1</mark> (<mark>ET-1</mark>) was downregulated when the cells were cultured with the purified peptide.
Moreover, the peptide blocked the activation of <mark>p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinase</mark>.
These results indicated that this Spirulina sp.-derived peptide warrants further investigation as a potential pharmacological inhibitor of <mark>ACE</mark> and vascular dysfunction.
Stimulation of oral fibroblast <mark>chemokine receptors</mark> identifies <mark>CCR3</mark> and <mark>CCR4</mark> as potential wound healing targets.
The focus of this study was to determine which <mark>chemokine receptors</mark> are present on oral fibroblasts and whether these receptors influence proliferation, migration, and/or the release of wound healing mediators.
This information may provide insight into the superior wound healing characteristics of the oral mucosa.
The gingiva fibroblasts expressed 12 different <mark>chemokine receptors</mark> (<mark>CCR3</mark>, <mark>CCR4</mark>, <mark>CCR6</mark>, <mark>CCR9</mark>, <mark>CCR10</mark>, <mark>CXCR1</mark>, <mark>CXCR2</mark>, <mark>CXCR4</mark>, <mark>CXCR5</mark>, <mark>CXCR7</mark>, <mark>CX3CR1</mark>, and <mark>XCR1</mark>), as analyzed by flow cytometry.
Fourteen corresponding <mark>chemokines</mark> (<mark>CCL5</mark>, <mark>CCL15</mark>, <mark>CCL20</mark>, <mark>CCL22</mark>, <mark>CCL25</mark>, <mark>CCL27</mark>, <mark>CCL28</mark>, <mark>CXCL1</mark>, <mark>CXCL8</mark>, <mark>CXCL11</mark>, <mark>CXCL12</mark>, <mark>CXCL13</mark>, <mark>CX3CL1</mark>, and <mark>XCL1</mark>) were used to study the activation of these receptors on gingiva fibroblasts.
Twelve of these fourteen <mark>chemokines</mark> stimulated gingiva fibroblast migration (all except for <mark>CXCL8</mark> and <mark>CXCL12</mark>).
Five of the <mark>chemokines</mark> stimulated proliferation (<mark>CCL5</mark>/<mark>CCR3</mark>, <mark>CCL15</mark>/<mark>CCR3</mark>, <mark>CCL22</mark>/<mark>CCR4</mark>, <mark>CCL28</mark>/<mark>CCR3</mark>/<mark>CCR10</mark>, and <mark>XCL1</mark>/<mark>XCR1</mark>).
Furthermore, <mark>CCL28</mark>/<mark>CCR3</mark>/<mark>CCR10</mark> and <mark>CCL22</mark>/<mark>CCR4</mark> stimulation increased <mark>IL-6</mark> secretion and <mark>CCL28</mark>/<mark>CCR3</mark>/<mark>CCR10</mark> together with <mark>CCL27</mark>/<mark>CCR10</mark> upregulated <mark>HGF</mark> secretion.
Moreover, <mark>TIMP-1</mark> secretion was reduced by <mark>CCL15</mark>/<mark>CCR3</mark>.
In conclusion, this in-vitro study identifies chemokine receptor-ligand pairs which may be used in future targeted wound healing strategies.
In particular, we identified the <mark>chemokine receptors</mark> <mark>CCR3</mark> and <mark>CCR4</mark>, and the mucosa specific chemokine <mark>CCL28</mark>, as having an predominant role in oral wound healing by increasing human gingiva fibroblast proliferation, migration, and the secretion of <mark>IL-6</mark> and <mark>HGF</mark> and reducing the secretion of <mark>TIMP-1</mark>.
<mark>Psoriasin</mark> promotes invasion, aggregation and survival of pancreatic cancer cells; association with disease progression.
<mark>Psoriasin</mark> (<mark>S100A7</mark>) is an 11-kDa small <mark>calcium binding protein</mark> initially isolated from psoriatic skin lesions.
It belongs to the <mark>S100 family</mark> of proteins which play an important role in a range of cell functions including proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis.
Aberrant <mark>Psoriasin</mark> expression has been implicated in a range of cancers and is often associated with poor prognosis.
This study examined the role of <mark>Psoriasin</mark> on pancreatic cancer cell functions and the implication in progression of the disease.
Expression of <mark>Psoriasin</mark> was determined in a cohort of pancreatic tissues comprised of 126 pancreatic tumours and 114 adjacent non-tumour pancreatic tissues.
Knockdown and overexpression of <mark>Psoriasin</mark> in pancreatic cancer cells was performed using specifically constructed plasmids, which either had anti-Psoriasin ribozyme transgene or the full length human <mark>Psoriasin</mark> coding sequence.
<mark>Psoriasin</mark> knockdown and overexpression was verified using conventional RT-PCR and qPCR.
The effect of manipulating <mark>Psoriasin</mark> expression on pancreatic cancer cell functions was assessed using several in vitro cell function assays.
Local invasive pancreatic cancers extended beyond the pancreas expressed higher levels of <mark>Psoriasin</mark> transcripts compared with the cancers confined to the pancreas.
Primary tumours with distant metastases exhibited a reduced expression of <mark>Psoriasin</mark>.
<mark>Psoriasin</mark> overexpression cell lines exhibited significantly increased growth and migration compared to control cells.
In addition, <mark>Psoriasin</mark> overexpression resulted in increased pancreatic cancer cell invasion which was associated with upregulation of <mark>matrix metalloproteinase-2</mark> (<mark>MMP-2</mark>) and <mark>MMP-9</mark>.
Overexpression of <mark>Psoriasin</mark> also promoted aggregation and survival of pancreatic cancer cells when they lost anchorage.
Taken together, higher expression of <mark>Psoriasin</mark> was associated with local invasion in pancreatic cancers.
<mark>Psoriasin</mark> expression is associated with pancreatic cancer cell growth, migration, cell-matrix adhesion, and invasion via regulation of <mark>MMPs</mark>.
As such, the proposed implications of <mark>Psoriasin</mark> in invasion, disease progression and as a potential therapeutic target warrant further investigation.
Overexpression of <mark>Srcin1</mark> contributes to the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer.
The adaptor protein <mark>Srcin1</mark> is a novel <mark>Src-binding protein</mark> that regulates <mark>Src</mark> activation through <mark>C-terminal Src kinase</mark> (<mark>Csk</mark>).
<mark>Srcin1</mark> behaves as a tumour suppressor in breast cancer, but the role of <mark>Srcin1</mark> in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unknown.
In the present study, <mark>Srcin1</mark> expression in normal tissue was examined by tissue microarray and assessed by immunohistochemistry in 10 patients.
In addition, the biological impact of <mark>Srcin1</mark> knockdown on CRC cells was investigated in vitro and in vivo.
The results showed that <mark>Srcin1</mark> was expressed in different types of normal human tissues, whereas its expression was increased in human CRC tissues.
<mark>Srcin1</mark> expression also correlated with tumour progression.
The suppression of <mark>Srcin1</mark> induced cell differentiation and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest.
Furthermore, <mark>Srcin1</mark> increased cell growth as well as the capacity of migration and invasion in CRC cells.
<mark>Srcin1</mark> induced the activation of the <mark>Wnt</mark>/<mark>β-catenin</mark> signalling pathway.
Moreover, <mark>Srcin1</mark> suppression sensitized cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.
Together, these results demonstrate that <mark>Srcin1</mark> contributes to CRC carcinogenesis, invasion and metastasis.
These findings provide a rationale for a mechanistic approach to CRC treatment based on the development of <mark>Srcin1</mark>-targeted therapies.
The <mark>downstream of tyrosine kinase 7</mark> is reduced in lung cancer and is associated with poor survival of patients with lung cancer.
The <mark>downstream of tyrosine kinase 7</mark> (<mark>DOK7</mark>) is an adaptor protein mediating signalling transduction between receptors and intracellular downstream molecules.
Reduced expression of <mark>DOK7</mark> has been observed in breast cancer.
The present study aimed to investigate the role played by <mark>DOK7</mark> in lung cancer.
The expression of <mark>DOK7</mark> at both mRNA and protein levels was evaluated in human lung cancer.
A reduced expression of <mark>DOK7</mark> transcripts was seen in lung cancers compared with normal lung tissues.
Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that the reduced expression of <mark>DOK7</mark> was associated with poorer overall survival and progression-free survival of patients with lung cancer.
A further western blot analysis revealed a predominant expression of <mark>DOK7</mark> isoform 1 (<mark>DOK7V1</mark>) in normal lung tissues, which was reduced in lung cancer.
Forced overexpression of <mark>DOK7V1</mark> in lung cancer cell lines, A549 and H3122 resulted in a decrease of in vitro cell proliferation and migration, while adhesion to extracellular matrix was enhanced following the expression.
In conclusion, <mark>DOK7</mark> was reduced in lung cancer and reduced <mark>DOK7</mark> expression was associated with poorer survival.
<mark>DOK7</mark> isoform 1 plays an inhibitory role on the proliferation and migration of lung cancer cells in which <mark>Akt</mark> pathway may be involved.
Dose-dependent functions of <mark>fibroblast growth factor 9</mark> regulate the fate of murine XY primordial germ cells.
Male differentiation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) is initiated by the inhibition of entry into meiosis and exposure to male-inducing factor(s), which are regulated by somatic elements of the developing gonad.
<mark>Fibroblast growth factor 9</mark> (<mark>FGF9</mark>) produced by pre-Sertoli cells is essential for male gonadal differentiation and also contributes to survival and male differentiation of XY PGCs.
However, it is not clear how <mark>FGF9</mark> regulates PGC fate.
Using a PGC culture system, we identified dose-dependent, fate-determining functions of <mark>FGF9</mark> in XY PGCs.
Treatment with low levels of <mark>FGF9</mark> (0.2 ng/ml) increased expression of male-specific <mark>Dnmt3L</mark> and <mark>Nanos2</mark> in XY PGCs.
Conversely, treatment with high levels of <mark>FGF9</mark> (25 ng/ml) suppressed male-specific gene expression and stimulated proliferation of XY PGCs.
Western blotting showed that low <mark>FGF9</mark> treatment enhanced <mark>p38 MAPK</mark> (<mark>mitogen-activated protein kinase</mark>) phosphorylation in the same cells.
In contrast, high <mark>FGF9</mark> treatment significantly stimulated the <mark>ERK</mark> (<mark>extracellular signal-regulated kinase)1/2</mark> signaling pathway in XY PGCs.
We investigated the relationship between the <mark>ERK1/2</mark> signaling pathway stimulated by high <mark>FGF9</mark> and regulation of PGC proliferation.
An <mark>ERK1/2</mark> inhibitor (U0126) suppressed the PGC proliferation that would otherwise be stimulated by high <mark>FGF9</mark> treatment, and increased <mark>Nanos2</mark> expression in XY PGCs.
Conversely, a <mark>p38 MAPK</mark> inhibitor (SB202190) significantly suppressed <mark>Nanos2</mark> expression that would otherwise be stimulated by low <mark>FGF9</mark> in XY PGCs.
Taken together, our results suggest that stage-specific expression of <mark>FGF9</mark> in XY gonads regulates the balance between proliferation and differentiation of XY PGCs in a dose-dependent manner.
Novel <mark>nesprin-1</mark> mutations associated with dilated cardiomyopathy cause nuclear envelope disruption and defects in myogenesis.
<mark>Nesprins-1 and -2</mark> are highly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle and together with <mark>SUN</mark> (<mark>Sad1p/UNC84</mark>)-domain containing proteins and <mark>lamin A/C</mark> form the LInker of Nucleoskeleton-and-Cytoskeleton (LINC) bridging complex at the nuclear envelope (NE).
Mutations in <mark>nesprin-1/2</mark> have previously been found in patients with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) as well as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).
In this study, three novel rare variants (R8272Q, S8381C and N8406K) in the C-terminus of the <mark>SYNE1</mark> gene (<mark>nesprin-1</mark>) were identified in seven DCM patients by mutation screening.
Expression of these mutants caused nuclear morphology defects and reduced <mark>lamin A/C</mark> and <mark>SUN2</mark> staining at the NE.
GST pull-down indicated that <mark>nesprin-1</mark>/<mark>lamin</mark>/<mark>SUN</mark> interactions were disrupted.
<mark>Nesprin-1</mark> mutations were also associated with augmented activation of the <mark>ERK</mark> pathway in vitro and in hearts in vivo.
During C2C12 muscle cell differentiation, <mark>nesprin-1</mark> levels are increased concomitantly with <mark>kinesin light chain</mark> (<mark>KLC-1/2</mark>) and immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down showed that these proteins interacted via a recently identified LEWD domain in the C-terminus of <mark>nesprin-1</mark>.
Expression of <mark>nesprin-1</mark> mutants in C2C12 cells caused defects in myoblast differentiation and fusion associated with dysregulation of myogenic transcription factors and disruption of the <mark>nesprin-1</mark> and <mark>KLC-1/2</mark> interaction at the outer nuclear membrane.
Expression of <mark>nesprin-1α2</mark> WT and mutants in zebrafish embryos caused heart developmental defects that varied in severity.
These findings support a role for <mark>nesprin-1</mark> in myogenesis and muscle disease, and uncover a novel mechanism whereby disruption of the LINC complex may contribute to the pathogenesis of DCM.
<mark>MUC1</mark> in lung adenocarcinoma: cross-sectional genetic and serological study.
BACKGROUND: <mark>Mucin 1</mark> (<mark>MUC1</mark>) contributes to the growth and metastasis of various cancers, including lung cancer, and <mark>MUC1</mark> gene length polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to lung cancer and its prognosis.
In contrast, the association between rs4072037, a single nucleotide polymorphism in <mark>MUC1</mark>, and lung cancer has not been well studied.
METHODS: In the present study, we determined the rs4072037 genotype and measured serum <mark>KL-6</mark> levels to evaluate the association between lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and rs4072037 or serum <mark>KL-6</mark> levels.
DNA samples were available for 172 patients and these were included in the genomic analyses.
In addition, 304 patients were included in the serum analyses.
Furthermore, 276 healthy volunteers were included in both genomic and serum analyses.
RESULTS: The rs4072037 genotype was not associated with susceptibility to lung ADC or its prognosis.
Interestingly, serum <mark>KL-6</mark> levels significantly differed according to rs4072037 genotype in those with T1 or T2 (P < 0.001), N0 or N1 (P = 0.002) and M0 (P < 0.001), but not in those with T3 or T4 (P = 0.882), N2 or N3 (P = 0.616) and M1a or M1b (P = 0.501).
Serum <mark>KL-6</mark> levels were significantly associated with the presence of lung ADC, as well as with its progression and prognosis, indicating the crucial involvement of <mark>KL-6</mark>/<mark>MUC1</mark> in the development of lung cancer and its progression.
CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, we conclude that rs4072037 does not have a significant impact on the pathogenesis or prognosis of lung ADC, whereas serum <mark>KL-6</mark> levels, which might reflecting the molecular length of <mark>MUC1</mark>, are significantly associated with lung ADC.
Global analysis of <mark>H3</mark>K27me3 as an epigenetic marker in prostate cancer progression.
BACKGROUND: <mark>H3</mark>K27me3 histone marks shape the inhibition of gene transcription.
In prostate cancer, the deregulation of <mark>H3</mark>K27me3 marks might play a role in prostate tumor progression.
METHODS: We investigated genome-wide <mark>H3</mark>K27me3 histone methylation profile using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and 2X400K promoter microarrays to identify differentially-enriched regions in biopsy samples from prostate cancer patients.
<mark>H3</mark>K27me3 marks were assessed in 34 prostate tumors: 11 with Gleason score > 7 (GS > 7), 10 with Gleason score ≤ 7 (GS ≤ 7), and 13 morphologically normal prostate samples.
RESULTS: Here, <mark>H3</mark>K27me3 profiling identified an average of 386 enriched-genes on promoter regions in healthy control group versus 545 genes in GS ≤ 7 and 748 genes in GS > 7 group.
We then ran a factorial discriminant analysis (FDA) and compared the enriched genes in prostate-tumor biopsies and normal biopsies using ANOVA to identify significantly differentially-enriched genes.
The analysis identified <mark>ALG5</mark>, <mark>EXOSC8</mark>, <mark>CBX1</mark>, <mark>GRID2</mark>, <mark>GRIN3B</mark>, <mark>ING3</mark>, <mark>MYO1D</mark>, <mark>NPHP3</mark>-<mark>AS1</mark>, <mark>MSH6</mark>, <mark>FBXO11</mark>, <mark>SND1</mark>, <mark>SPATS2</mark>, <mark>TENM4</mark> and <mark>TRA2A</mark> genes.
These genes are possibly associated with prostate cancer.
Notably, the <mark>H3</mark>K27me3 histone mark emerged as a novel regulatory mechanism in poor-prognosis prostate cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point to epigenetic mark <mark>H3</mark>K27me3 as an important event in prostate carcinogenesis and progression.
The results reported here provide new molecular insights into the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.
Depletion of <mark>polycomb repressive complex 2</mark> core component <mark>EED</mark> impairs fetal hematopoiesis.
<mark>Polycomb repressive complex 2</mark> (<mark>PRC2</mark>), a <mark>H3K27me3 methyltransferase complex</mark>, promotes the development of many organs by silencing ectopic transcription program.
However, currently little is known about the role of <mark>PRC2</mark> in blood and vascular development.
In this study, we interrogated the function of <mark>embryonic ectoderm development</mark> (<mark>EED</mark>), a core <mark>PRC2</mark> component, in both endothelial and hematopoietic tissues by inactivating a floxed murine <mark>EED</mark> allele with Tie2Cre, which catalyzes recombination in endothelial and hematopoietic lineages.
Murine <mark>EED</mark>(fl/fl);Tie2Cre (<mark>EED</mark>(CKO)) embryos died at embryonic day (E) 13.5.
We did not observe structural abnormalities of blood vessels or cardiac valves, suggesting that <mark>EED</mark> is dispensable in endothelial cells for initial steps of vascular development.
<mark>EED</mark>(CKO) embryos were pale and had abnormal livers.
Flow cytometry of fetal liver cells showed that <mark>EED</mark> depletion significantly impeded erythroid maturation.
There was a corresponding increase in myeloid progenitors and granulocytes and macrophages, suggesting an attenuated differentiation path in myeloid lineages.
Moreover, <mark>EED</mark> depletion impaired the generation of hematopoietic stem cells.
Collectively, our study demonstrates that within Tie2Cre-recombined embryonic cells, <mark>EED</mark> is required for proper erythropoiesis and for formation of hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells, but is dispensable for endothelial lineage commitment and early vascular patterning.
Genetic Variation at the <mark>Sulfonylurea Receptor</mark>, Type 2 Diabetes, and Coronary Heart Disease.
Despite widespread clinical use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, the impact of sulfonylurea therapy on cardiovascular outcomes remains uncertain.
Studies of naturally occurring genetic variation can be used to anticipate the expected clinical consequences of a pharmacological therapy.
A common missense variant in the gene encoding a component of the <mark>sulfonylurea receptor</mark> (<mark>ABCC8</mark> p.A1369S) promotes closure of the target channel of sulfonylurea therapy and is associated with increased <mark>insulin</mark> secretion, thus mimicking the effects of sulfonylurea therapy.
Using individual-level data from 120,286 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from four large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the impact of this variant on cardiometabolic traits, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease.
The p.A1369S variant was associated with a significantly lower risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 0.93; 95% CI 0.91, 0.95; P = 1.2 × 10(-11)).
The variant was associated with increased BMI (+0.062 kg/m(2); 95% CI 0.037, 0.086; P = 8.1 × 10(-7)) but lower waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI, a marker of abdominal fat distribution.
Furthermore, p.A1369S was associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96, 0.99; P = 5.9 × 10(-4)).
These results suggest that, despite a known association with increased weight, long-term sulfonylurea therapy may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.
<mark>MMP9</mark> integrates multiple immunoregulatory pathways that discriminate high suppressive activity of human mesenchymal stem cells.
The mechanisms underlying mesenchymal stem cells' (MSC) suppressive potency are largely unknown.
We here show that highly suppressive human adipose tissue-derived MSC (AdMSC) display and induce a differential immunologic profile, upon ongoing AdMSC suppressive activity, promoting: (i) early correlated inhibition of <mark>IFN-gamma</mark> and <mark>TNF-alpha</mark> production, along <mark>IL-10</mark> increase, (ii) <mark>CD73</mark>+<mark>Foxp3</mark>+Treg subset expansion, and (iii) specific correlations between gene expression increases, such as: <mark>MMP9</mark> correlated with <mark>CCL22</mark>, <mark>TNF</mark>, <mark>FASL</mark>, <mark>RUNX3</mark>, and <mark>SEMAD4</mark> in AdMSC and, in T cells, <mark>MMP9</mark> upregulation correlated with <mark>CCR4</mark>, <mark>IL4</mark> and <mark>TBX21</mark>, among others, whereas <mark>MMP2</mark> correlated with <mark>BCL2</mark> and <mark>LRRC31</mark>.
<mark>MMP9</mark> emerged as an integrating molecule for both AdMSC and T cells in molecular networks built with our gene expression data, and we confirmed upregulation of <mark>MMP9</mark> and <mark>MMP2</mark> at the protein level, in AdMSC and T cells, respectively.
<mark>MMP2/9</mark> inhibition significantly decreased AdMSC suppressive effect, confirming their important role in suppressive acitivity.
We conclude that <mark>MMP9 and 2</mark> are robust new players involved in human MSC immunoregulatory mechanisms, and the higher suppressive activity correlates to their capacity to trigger a coordinated action of multiple specific molecules, mobilizing various immunoregulatory mechanisms.
Transforming activity and therapeutic targeting of <mark>C-terminal-binding protein 2</mark> in <mark>Apc</mark>-mutated neoplasia.
Overexpression of the transcriptional coregulators <mark>C-terminal binding proteins 1 and 2</mark> (<mark>CtBP1 and 2</mark>) occurs in many human solid tumors and is associated with poor prognosis.
<mark>CtBP</mark> modulates oncogenic gene expression programs and is an emerging drug target, but its oncogenic role is unclear.
Consistent with this oncogenic potential, exogenous <mark>CtBP2</mark> transformed primary mouse and human cells to anchorage independence similarly to mutant <mark>H-Ras</mark>.
To investigate <mark>CtBP</mark>'s contribution to in vivo tumorigenesis, <mark>Apc</mark>(min/+) mice, which succumb to massive intestinal polyposis, were bred to <mark>Ctbp2</mark>(+/-) mice.
<mark>CtBP</mark> interacts with <mark>adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein</mark>, and is stabilized in both <mark>APC</mark>-mutated human colon cancers and <mark>Apc</mark>(min/+) intestinal polyps.
<mark>Ctbp2</mark> heterozygosity increased the median survival of <mark>Apc</mark>(min/+) mice from 21 to 48 weeks, and reduced polyp formation by 90%, with <mark>Ctbp2</mark>(+/-) polyps exhibiting reduced levels of <mark>b-catenin</mark> and its oncogenic transcriptional target, <mark>cyclin D1</mark>.
<mark>CtBP</mark>'s potential as a therapeutic target was studied by treating <mark>Apc</mark>(min/+) mice with the <mark>CtBP</mark> small-molecule inhibitors 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyric acid and 2-hydroxy-imino phenylpyruvic acid, both of which reduced polyposis by more than half compared with vehicle treatment.
Phenocopying <mark>Ctbp2</mark> deletion, both <mark>Ctbp</mark> inhibitors caused substantial decreases in the protein level of <mark>Ctbp2</mark>, as well its oncogenic partner <mark>b-catenin</mark>, and the effects of the inhibitors on <mark>CtBP</mark> and <mark>b-catenin</mark> levels could be modeled in an <mark>APC</mark>-mutated human colon cancer cell line.
<mark>CtBP2</mark> is thus a druggable transforming oncoprotein critical for the evolution of neoplasia driven by <mark>Apc</mark> mutation.
A <mark>TSPO</mark> ligand attenuates brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage.
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease without effective treatment.
After ICH, the immediate infiltration of leukocytes and activation of microglia are accompanied by a rapid up-regulation of the 18-kDa translocator protein (<mark>TSPO</mark>).
<mark>TSPO</mark> ligands have shown anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties in models of CNS injury.
In this study, we determined the impact of a <mark>TSPO</mark> ligand, etifoxine, on brain injury and inflammation in 2 mouse models of ICH.
<mark>TSPO</mark> was up-regulated in <mark>Iba1</mark>(+) cells from brains of patients with ICH and in <mark>CD11b</mark>(+)<mark>CD45</mark>(int) cells from mice subjected to collagenase-induced ICH.
Etifoxine significantly reduced neurodeficits and perihematomal brain edema after ICH induction by injection of either autologous blood or collagenase.
In collagenase-induced ICH mice, the protection of etifoxine was associated with reduced leukocyte infiltration into the brain and microglial production of <mark>IL-6</mark> and <mark>TNF-α</mark>.
Etifoxine improved blood-brain barrier integrity and diminished cell death.
Notably, the protective effect of etifoxine was abolished in mice depleted of microglia by using a <mark>colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor</mark> inhibitor.
These results indicate that the <mark>TSPO</mark> ligand etifoxine attenuates brain injury and inflammation after ICH.
<mark>TSPO</mark> may be a viable therapeutic target that requires further investigations in ICH.-Li, M., Ren, H., Sheth, K. N., Shi, F.-D., Liu, Q. A <mark>TSPO</mark> ligand attenuates brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage.
<mark>RABL2</mark> interacts with the <mark>intraflagellar transport-B complex</mark> and <mark>CEP19</mark> and participates in ciliary assembly.
Proteins localized to the basal body and the centrosome play crucial roles in ciliary assembly and function.
Although <mark>RABL2</mark> and <mark>CEP19</mark> are conserved in ciliated organisms and have been implicated in ciliary/flagellar functions, their roles are poorly understood.
Here we show that <mark>RABL2</mark> interacts with <mark>CEP19</mark> and is recruited to the mother centriole and basal body in a <mark>CEP19</mark>-dependent manner and that <mark>CEP19</mark> is recruited to the centriole probably via its binding to the centrosomal protein <mark>FGFR1OP</mark>.
Disruption of the <mark>RABL2</mark> gene in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii results in the nonflagellated phenotype, suggesting a crucial role of <mark>RABL2</mark> in ciliary/flagellar assembly.
We also show that <mark>RABL2</mark> interacts, in its GTP-bound state, with the <mark>intraflagellar transport (IFT)-B complex</mark> via the <mark>IFT74</mark>-<mark>IFT81</mark> heterodimer and that the interaction is disrupted by a mutation found in male infertile mice (Mot mice) with a sperm flagella motility defect.
Intriguingly, <mark>RABL2</mark> binds to <mark>CEP19</mark> and the <mark>IFT74</mark>-<mark>IFT81</mark> heterodimer in a mutually exclusive manner.
Furthermore, exogenous expression of the GDP-locked or Mot-type <mark>RABL2</mark> mutant in human cells results in mild defects in ciliary assembly.
These results indicate that <mark>RABL2</mark> localized to the basal body plays crucial roles in ciliary/flagellar assembly via its interaction with the <mark>IFT-B complex</mark>.
Arabidopsis <mark>CP12</mark> mutants have reduced levels of <mark>phosphoribulokinase</mark> and impaired function of the Calvin-Benson cycle.
<mark>CP12</mark> is a small, redox-sensitive protein, the most detailed understanding of which is the <mark>thioredoxin</mark>-mediated regulation of the Calvin-Benson cycle, where it facilitates the formation of a complex between <mark>glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase</mark> (<mark>GAPDH</mark>) and <mark>phosphoribulokinase</mark> (<mark>PRK</mark>) in response to changes in light intensity.
In most organisms, <mark>CP12</mark> proteins are encoded by small multigene families, where the importance of each individual <mark>CP12</mark> gene in vivo has not yet been reported.
We used Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA mutants and RNAi transgenic lines with reduced levels of <mark>CP12</mark> transcript to determine the relative importance of each of the <mark>CP12</mark> genes.
We found that single <mark>cp12-1</mark>, <mark>cp12-2</mark>, and <mark>cp12-3</mark> mutants do not develop a severe photosynthetic or growth phenotype.
In contrast, reductions of both <mark>CP12-1</mark> and <mark>CP12-2</mark> transcripts lead to reductions in photosynthetic capacity and to slower growth and reduced seed yield.
No clear phenotype for <mark>CP12-3</mark> was evident.
Additionally, the levels of <mark>PRK</mark> protein are reduced in the <mark>cp12-1</mark>, <mark>cp12-1/2</mark>, and multiple mutants.
Our results suggest that there is functional redundancy between <mark>CP12-1</mark> and <mark>CP12-2</mark> in Arabidopsis where these proteins have a role in determining the level of <mark>PRK</mark> in mature leaves and hence photosynthetic capacity.
Regulation of lung endothelial permeability and inflammatory responses by prostaglandin A2: role of <mark>EP4 receptor</mark>.
The role of prostaglandin A2 (PGA2) in modulation of vascular endothelial function is unknown.
We investigated effects of PGA2 on pulmonary endothelial cell (EC) permeability and inflammatory activation and identified a receptor mediating these effects.
PGA2 enhanced the EC barrier and protected against barrier dysfunction caused by vasoactive peptide thrombin and proinflammatory bacterial wall lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
Receptor screening using pharmacological and molecular inhibitory approaches identified <mark>EP4</mark> as a novel <mark>PGA2 receptor</mark>.
<mark>EP4</mark> mediated barrier-protective effects of PGA2 by activating <mark>Rap1/Rac1 GTPase</mark> and <mark>protein kinase A</mark> targets at cell adhesions and cytoskeleton: <mark>VE-cadherin</mark>, <mark>p120-catenin</mark>, <mark>ZO-1</mark>, <mark>cortactin</mark>, and <mark>VASP</mark>.
PGA2 also suppressed LPS-induced inflammatory signaling by inhibiting the <mark>NFκB</mark> pathway and expression of <mark>EC adhesion molecules</mark> <mark>ICAM1</mark> and <mark>VCAM1</mark>.
These effects were abolished by pharmacological or molecular inhibition of <mark>EP4</mark>.
In vivo, PGA2 was protective in two distinct models of acute lung injury (ALI): LPS-induced inflammatory injury and two-hit ALI caused by suboptimal mechanical ventilation and injection of thrombin receptor-activating peptide.
These protective effects were abolished in mice with endothelial-specific <mark>EP4</mark> knockout.
The results suggest a novel role for the PGA2-<mark>EP4</mark> axis in vascular EC protection that is critical for improvement of pathological states associated with increased vascular leakage and inflammation.
<mark>MRE11</mark> stability is regulated by <mark>CK2</mark>-dependent interaction with <mark>R2TP complex</mark>.
The <mark>MRN</ma<mark>MRN (MRE11-R<mark>MRE11</mark>N<mark>RAD50</mark>c<mark>NBS1</mark>ex</mark> is essential for repair of DNA double-strand breaks and stalled replication forks.
Mutations of the <mark>MRN complex</mark> subunit <mark>MRE11</mark> cause the hereditary cancer-susceptibility disease ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD).
Here we show that <mark>MRE11</mark> directly interacts with <mark>PIH1D1</mark>, a subunit of <mark>heat-shock protein 90 cochaperone R2TP complex</mark>, which is required for the assembly of large protein complexes, such as <mark>RNA polymerase II</mark>, <mark>small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins</mark> and <mark>mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1</mark>.
The <mark>MRE11</mark>-<mark>PIH1D1</mark> interaction is dependent on <mark>casein kinase 2</mark> (<mark>CK2</mark>) phosphorylation of two acidic sequences within the <mark>MRE11</mark> C terminus containing serines 558/561 and 688/689.
Conversely, the <mark>PIH1D1</mark> phospho-binding domain PIH-N is required for association with <mark>MRE11</mark> phosphorylated by <mark>CK2</mark>.
Consistent with these findings, depletion of <mark>PIH1D1</mark> resulted in <mark>MRE11</mark> destabilization and affected DNA-damage repair processes dependent on <mark>MRE11</mark>.
Additionally, mutations of serines 688/689, which abolish <mark>PIH1D1</mark> binding, also resulted in decreased <mark>MRE11</mark> stability.
As depletion of <mark>R2TP</mark> frequently leads to instability of its substrates and as truncation mutation of <mark>MRE11</mark> lacking serines 688/689 leads to decreased levels of the <mark>MRN complex</mark> both in ATLD patients and an ATLD mouse model, our results suggest that the <mark>MRN complex</mark> is a novel <mark>R2TP complex</mark> substrate and that their interaction is regulated by <mark>CK2</mark> phosphorylation.
Aberrant <mark>caveolin-1</mark>-mediated <mark>Smad</mark> signaling and proliferation identified by analysis of adenine 474 deletion mutation (c.474delA) in patient fibroblasts: a new perspective on the mechanism of pulmonary hypertension.
A heterozygous <mark>caveolin-1</mark> c.474delA mutation has been identified in a family with heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
This frameshift mutation leads to a <mark>caveolin-1</mark> protein that contains all known functional domains but has a change in only the final 20 amino acids of the C-terminus.
Here we studied how this mutation alters <mark>caveolin-1</mark> function, using patient-derived fibroblasts.
Transmission electron microscopy showed that fibroblasts carrying the c.474delA mutation form typical caveolae.
Expression of mutated <mark>caveolin-1</mark> in <mark>caveolin-1</mark>-null mouse fibroblasts failed to induce formation of caveolae due to retention of the mutated protein in the endoplasmic reticulum.
However, coexpression of wild-type <mark>caveolin-1</mark> with mutated <mark>caveolin-1</mark> restored the ability to form caveolae.
Importantly, fibroblasts carrying the mutation showed twofold increase in proliferation rate associated with hyperphosphorylation of <mark>Smad1/5/8</mark>.
This mutation impaired the antiproliferative function of <mark>caveolin-1</mark>.
Inhibition of <mark>type I TGFβ receptors</mark> <mark>ALK1/2/3/6</mark> responsible for phosphorylation of <mark>Smad1/5/8</mark> reduced the hyperproliferation seen in c.474delA fibroblasts.
These results demonstrate the critical role of the final 20 amino acids of <mark>caveolin-1</mark> in modulating fibroblast proliferation by dampening <mark>Smad</mark> signaling and suggest that augmented <mark>Smad</mark> signaling and fibroblast hyperproliferation are contributing factors in the pathogenesis of PAH in patients with <mark>caveolin-1</mark> c.474delA mutation.
<mark>Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1</mark> (<mark>UCHL1</mark>) is associated with stem-like cancer cell functions in pediatric high-grade glioma.
Pediatric high-grade gliomas represent 8-12% of all primary tumors of the nervous system in children.
Five-year survival for these pediatric aggressive tumors is poor (15-35%) indicating the need to develop better treatments for pediatric high-grade gliomas.
In this work we used SF188 and SJ-GBM2 cell lines to study the function of the <mark>ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1</mark> (<mark>UCHL1</mark>), a <mark>deubiquitinase</mark> de-regulated in several cancers, in pediatric high-grade gliomas.
<mark>UCHL1</mark> depletion in SF188 and SJ-GBM2 glioma cells was associated with decreased cell proliferation and invasion, along with a reduced ability to grow in soft agar and to form spheres (i.e. self-renewal measure).
A 70% reduction in <mark>Wnt</mark> signaling was also observed in the SF188 and SJ-GBM2 <mark>UCHL1</mark> knockdowns (KDs) using a <mark>TCF</mark>-dependent TOPflash reporter assay.
Transcriptome comparisons of <mark>UCHL1</mark> KDs versus vector control identified a list of 306 differentially expressed genes (at least 2-fold change; p &lt;0.05) which included genes known to be involved in cancer like <mark>ACTA2</mark>, <mark>POSTN</mark>, <mark>LIF</mark>, <mark>FBXL7</mark>, <mark>FBXW11</mark>, <mark>GDF15</mark>, <mark>HEY2</mark>, but also potential novel genes such us <mark>IGLL5</mark>, <mark>ABCA4</mark>, <mark>AQP3</mark>, <mark>AQP4</mark>, <mark>CALB1</mark>, and <mark>ALK</mark>.
Bioinformatics gene ontology (GO) analysis of these 306 genes revealed significant enrichment in "signal peptides", "extracellular matrix"and "secreted proteins" GO Terms. "Angiogenesis and blood vessel development", "neuron differentiation/development", cell adhesion", and "cell migration" also showed significant enrichment in our GO analysis.
Top canonical pathways identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) included "<mark>Clathrin</mark>-mediated Endocytosis Signaling" (p = 5.14x10-4), "Virus Entry via Endocytic Pathways" (p = 6.15x 10-4), and "<mark>High Mobility Group-Box 1</mark> (<mark>HMGB1</mark>) Signaling" (p = 6.15x10-4).
While <mark>FGF2</mark>, <mark>IL1B</mark>, <mark>TNF</mark> and <mark>PDGFB</mark> were predicted as top upstream regulators (p &lt; 2x10-16) of the <mark>UCHL1</mark> KD-associated transcriptome.
Aberrant expression of <mark>UCHL1</mark> in pediatric high-grade gliomas may promote cell invasion, transformation, and self-renewal properties, at least in part, by modulating <mark>Wnt</mark>/<mark>Beta catenin</mark> activity.
<mark>UCHL1</mark> might act as an oncogene in glioma within the gene network that imparts stem-like characteristics to these cancer cells.
Distinct gene expression profiles associated with <mark>Notch</mark> ligands <mark>Delta-like 4</mark> and <mark>Jagged1</mark> in plaque material from peripheral artery disease patients: a pilot study.
BACKGROUND: The lack of early diagnosis, progression markers and effective pharmacological treatment has dramatic unfavourable effects on clinical outcomes in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).
Addressing these issues will require dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease.
We sought to characterize the <mark>Notch</mark> signaling and atherosclerosis relevant markers in lesions from femoral arteries of symptomatic PAD patients.
METHODS: Plaque material from the common femoral, superficial femoral or popliteal arteries of 20 patients was removed by directional atherectomy.
RNA was obtained from 9 out of 20 samples and analysed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
RESULTS: We detected expression of <mark>Notch</mark> ligands <mark>Delta-like 4</mark> (<mark>Dll4</mark>) and <mark>Jagged1</mark> (<mark>Jag1</mark>), of <mark>Notch</mark> target genes <mark>Hes1</mark>, <mark>Hey1</mark>, <mark>Hey2</mark>, <mark>HeyL</mark> and of markers of plaque inflammation and stability such as <mark>vascular cell adhesion molecule 1</mark> (<mark>VCAM1</mark>), <mark>smooth muscle 22</mark> (<mark>SM22</mark>), <mark>cyclooxygenase 2</mark> (<mark>COX2</mark>), <mark>Bcl2</mark>, <mark>CD68</mark> and <mark>miRNAs 21-5p, 125a-5p, 126-5p,146-5p, 155-5p, 424-5p</mark>.
We found an "inflamed plaque" gene expression profile characterized by high <mark>Dll4</mark> associated to medium/high <mark>CD68</mark>, <mark>COX2</mark>, <mark>VCAM1</mark>, <mark>Hes1</mark>, <mark>miR126</mark>-5p, <mark>miR146a</mark>-5p, <mark>miR155</mark>-5p, <mark>miR424</mark>-5p and low <mark>Jag1</mark>, <mark>SM22</mark>, <mark>Bcl2</mark>, <mark>Hey2</mark>, <mark>HeyL</mark>, <mark>miR125a</mark>-5p (2/9 patients) and a "stable plaque" profile characterized by high <mark>Jag1</mark> associated to medium/high <mark>Hey2</mark>, <mark>HeyL</mark>, <mark>SM22</mark>, <mark>Bcl2</mark>, <mark>miR125a</mark> and low <mark>Dll4</mark>, <mark>CD68</mark>, <mark>COX2</mark>, <mark>VCAM1</mark>, <mark>miR126</mark>-5p, <mark>miR146a</mark>-5p, <mark>miR155</mark>-5p, <mark>miR424</mark>-5p (3/9 patients).
The remaining patients (4/9) showed a plaque profile with intermediate characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the existence of a gene signature associated to <mark>Notch</mark> activation by specific ligands that could be predictive of PAD progression.
Oncogenic activity of amplified <mark>miniature chromosome maintenance 8</mark> in human malignancies.
<mark>Miniatu<mark>Miniature chromosome maintenance</mark>pr<mark>MCM</mark>ins</mark> play critical roles in DNA replication licensing, initiation and elongation.
<mark>MCM8</mark>, one of the <mark>MCM</ma<mark>MCM proteins</mark> playing a critical role in DNA repairing and recombination, was found to have overexpression and increased DNA copy number in a variety of human malignancies.
The gain of <mark>MCM8</mark> is associated with aggressive clinical features of several human cancers.
Increased expression of <mark>MCM8</mark> in prostate cancer is associated with cancer recurrence.
Forced expression of <mark>MCM8</mark> in RWPE1 cells, the immortalized but non-transformed prostate epithelial cell line, exhibited fast cell growth and transformation, while knock down of <mark>MCM8</mark> in PC3, DU145 and LNCaP cells induced cell growth arrest, and decreased tumour volumes and mortality of severe combined immunodeficiency mice xenografted with PC3 and DU145 cells.
<mark>MCM8</mark> bound <mark>cyclin D1</mark> and activated <mark>Rb protein</mark> phosphorylation by <mark>cyclin-dependent kinase 4</mark> in vitro and in vivo.
The <mark>cyclin D1</mark>/<mark>MCM8</mark> interaction is required for <mark>Rb</mark> phosphorylation and S-phase entry in cancer cells.
As a result, our study showed that copy number increase and overexpression of <mark>MCM8</mark> may play critical roles in human cancer development.
<mark>CYP4A</mark> in tumor-associated macrophages promotes pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis.
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play an essential role in metastasis.
However, what enables TAMs to have a superior capacity to establish pre-metastatic microenvironment in distant organs is unclear.
Here we have begun to uncover the effects of <mark>cytochr<mark>cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4<mark>(CYP) 4A</mark> in TAMs on lung pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis.
<mark>CYP4A</mark>(+) TAM infiltration was positively associated with metastasis, pre-metastatic niche formation and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients.
The pharmacological inhibition of <mark>CYP4A</mark> reduced lung pre-metastatic niche formation (evidenced by a decrease in <mark>vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1</mark> positive (<mark>VEGFR1</mark>(+)) myeloid cell recruitment and pro-metastatic protein expression) and metastatic burden, accompanied with TAM polarization away from the M2 phenotype in spontaneous metastasis models of 4T1 breast cancer and B16F10 melanoma.
Co-implantation of 4T1 cells with <mark>CYP4A10</mark>(high) macrophages promoted lung pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis.
Depletion of TAMs disrupted lung pre-metastatic niches and thereby prevented metastasis.
Treatment with the CM from <mark>CYP4A10</mark>(high) M2 macrophages (M2) increased pre-metastatic niche formation and metastatic burden in the lungs, whereas <mark>CYP4A</mark> inhibition attenuated these effects.
In vitro TAM polarization away from the M2 phenotype induced by <mark>CYP4A</mark> inhibition decreased <mark>VEGFR1</mark>(+) myeloid cell migration and <mark>fibronectin</mark> expression, accompanied with downregulation of <mark>STAT3</mark> signaling.
Conversely, overexpression of <mark>CYP4A</mark> or exogenous addition of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid promoted M2 polarization and cytokine production of macrophages and thereby enhanced migration of <mark>VEGFR1</mark>(+) myeloid cells, which were reversed by siRNA or pharmacological inhibition of <mark>STAT3</mark>.
Importantly, a combined blocking M2 macrophage-derived factors <mark>TGF-β</mark>, <mark>VEGF</mark> and <mark>SDF-1</mark> abolished <mark>VEGFR1</mark>(+) myeloid cell migration and fibroblast activation induced by <mark>CYP4A</mark>.
In summary, <mark>CYP4A</mark> in TAMs is crucial for lung pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis, and may serve as a potential therapeutic target in human cancer.
Deletion of <mark>RhoA</mark> in <mark>Progesterone Receptor</mark>-Expressing Cells Leads to Luteal Insufficiency and Infertility in Female Mice.
<mark>Ras homolog gene family, member A</mark> (<mark>RhoA</mark>) is widely expressed throughout the female reproductive system.
To assess its role in <mark>progesterone receptor</mark>-expressing cells, we generated <mark>RhoA</mark> conditional knockout mice <mark>RhoA</mark>d/d (<mark>RhoA</mark>f/f-Pgr-Cre+/-).
<mark>RhoA</mark>d/d female mice had comparable mating activity, serum <mark>luteinizing hormone</mark>, <mark>prolactin</mark>, and estradiol levels and ovulation with control but were infertile with progesterone insufficiency, indicating impaired steroidogenesis in <mark>RhoA</mark>d/d corpus luteum (CL).
<mark>RhoA</mark> was highly expressed in wild-type luteal cells and conditionally deleted in <mark>RhoA</mark>d/d CL.
Gestation day 3.5 (D3.5) <mark>RhoA</mark>d/d ovaries had reduced numbers of CL, less defined corpus luteal cord formation, and disorganized CL <mark>collagen IV</mark> staining.
<mark>RhoA</mark>d/d CL had lipid droplet and free cholesterol accumulation, indicating the availability of cholesterol for steroidogenesis, but disorganized <mark>β-actin</mark> and <mark>vimentin</mark> staining, indicating disrupted cytoskeleton integrity.
Cytoskeleton is important for cytoplasmic cholesterol movement to mitochondria and for regulating mitochondria.
Dramatically reduced expression of mitochondrial markers <mark>heat shock protein 60</mark> (<mark>HSP60</mark>), <mark>voltage-dependent anion channel</mark>, and <mark>StAR</mark> was detected in RhoAd/d CL.
<mark>StAR</mark> carries out the rate-limiting step of steroidogenesis.
<mark>StAR</mark> messenger RNA expression was reduced in RU486-treated D3.5 wild-type CL and tended to be induced in progesterone-treated D3.5 <mark>RhoA</mark>d/d CL, with parallel changes of <mark>HSP60</mark> expression.
These data demonstrated the in vivo function of <mark>RhoA</mark> in CL luteal cell cytoskeleton integrity, cholesterol transport, <mark>StAR</mark> expression, and progesterone synthesis, and a positive feedback on <mark>StAR</mark> expression in CL by progesterone signaling.
These findings provide insights into mechanisms of progesterone insufficiency.
Analysis of Serum <mark>Cytokines</mark> and Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms of <mark>SOD1</mark>, <mark>SOD2</mark>, and <mark>CAT</mark> in Erysipelas Patients.
Increased free radical production had been documented in group A (beta-hemolytic) streptococcus infection cases.
Comparing 71 erysipelas patients to 55 age-matched healthy individuals, we sought for <mark>CAT</mark>, <mark>SOD1</mark>, and <mark>SOD2</mark> single polymorphism mutation (SNPs) interactions with erysipelas' predisposition and serum <mark>cytokine</mark> levels in the acute and recovery phases of erysipelas infection.
Whereas female patients had a higher predisposition to erysipelas, male patients were prone to having a facial localization of the infection.
The presence of <mark>SOD1</mark> G7958, <mark>SOD2</mark> T2734, and <mark>CAT</mark> C262 alleles was linked to erysipelas' predisposition.
T and C alleles of <mark>SOD2</mark> T2734C individually were linked to patients with bullous and erythematous erysipelas, respectively.
G and A alleles of <mark>SOD1</mark> G7958A individually were associated with lower limbs and higher body part localizations of the infection, respectively.
Serum levels of <mark>IL-1beta</mark>, <mark>CCL11</mark>, <mark>IL-2Ralpha</mark>, <mark>CXCL9</mark>, <mark>TRAIL</mark>, <mark>PDGF-BB</mark>, and <mark>CCL4</mark> were associated with symptoms accompanying the infection, while <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-9</mark>, <mark>IL-10</mark>, <mark>IL-13</mark>, <mark>IL-15</mark>, <mark>IL-17</mark>, <mark>G-CSF</mark>, and <mark>VEGF</mark> were associated with predisposition and recurrence of erysipelas.
While variations of <mark>IL-1beta</mark>, <mark>IL-7</mark>, <mark>IL-8</mark>, <mark>IL-17</mark>, <mark>CCL5</mark>, and <mark>HGF</mark> were associated with the <mark>SOD2</mark> T2734C SNP, variations of <mark>PDFG-BB</mark> and <mark>CCL2</mark> were associated with the <mark>CAT</mark> C262T SNP.
<mark>Calcium sensing receptor</mark> protects high glucose-induced energy metabolism disorder via blocking <mark>gp78</mark>-ubiquitin proteasome pathway.
Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major complication and fatal cause of the patients with diabetes.
The <mark>calcium sensing receptor</mark> (<mark>CaSR</mark>) is a <mark>G protein-coupled receptor</mark>, which is involved in maintaining calcium homeostasis, regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, and so on.
In our previous study, we found that <mark>CaSR</mark> expression, intracellular calcium levels and cardiac function were all significantly decreased in DCM rats; however, the exact mechanism are not clear yet.
The present study revealed the protective role of <mark>CaSR</mark> in myocardial energy metabolism disorder induced by high glucose (HG) as well as the underlying mechanism.
Here, we demonstrated that HG decreased the expression of <mark>CaSR</mark>, mitochondrial fusion proteins (<mark>Mfn1</mark>, <mark>Mfn2</mark>), cell gap junction related proteins (<mark>Cx43</mark>, <mark>beta-catenin</mark>, <mark>N-cadherin</mark>), and intracellular ATP concentration.
In contrast, HG increased extracellular ATP concentration, the expression of <mark>gp78</mark>, mitochondrial fission proteins (<mark>Fis1</mark>, <mark>Drp1</mark>), and the ubiquitination levels of <mark>Mfn1</mark>, <mark>Mfn2</mark> and <mark>Cx43</mark>.
Moreover, <mark>CaSR</mark> agonist and <mark>gp78</mark>-siRNA significantly reduced the above changes.
Taken together, these results suggest that HG induces myocardial energy metabolism disorder via decrease of <mark>CaSR</mark> expression, and activation of <mark>gp78</mark>-ubiquitin proteasome system.
In turn, these effects disrupt the structure and function of the mitochondria and the cell gap junction, result in the reduced ATP synthesis and the increased ATP leakage.
Stimulation of <mark>CaSR</mark> significantly attenuates HG-induced abnormal myocardial energy metabolism, suggesting <mark>CaSR</mark> would be a promising potential therapeutic target for DCM.
Targeting <mark>group I p21-activated kinases</mark> to control malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor growth and metastasis.
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are devastating sarcomas for which no effective medical therapies are available.
Over 50% of MPSNTs are associated with mutations in <mark>NF1</mark> <mark>tumor suppressor gene</mark>, resulting in activation of <mark>Ras</mark> and its effectors, including the <mark>Raf</mark>/<mark>Mek</mark>/<mark>Erk</mark> and <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>mTORC1</mark> signaling cascades, and also the <mark>WNT</mark>/<mark>β-catenin</mark> pathway.
As <mark>Group I p21-activated kinases</mark> (<mark>Group I Paks</mark>, <mark>PAK1/2/3</mark>) have been shown to modulate <mark>Ras</mark>-driven oncogenesis, we asked if these enzymes might regulate signaling in MPNSTs.
In this study we found a strong positive correlation between the activity of <mark>PAK1/2/3</mark> and the stage of human MPNSTs.
We determined that reducing <mark>Group I Pak</mark> activity diminished MPNST cell proliferation and motility, and that these effects were not accompanied by significant blockade of the <mark>Raf</mark>/<mark>Mek</mark>/<mark>Erk</mark> pathway, but rather by reductions in <mark>Akt</mark> and <mark>β-catenin</mark> activity.
Using the small molecule <mark>PAK1/2/3</mark> inhibitor Frax1036 and the <mark>MEK1/2</mark> inhibitor PD0325901, we showed that the combination of these two agents synergistically inhibited MPNST cell growth in vitro and dramatically decreased local and metastatic MPNST growth in animal models.
Taken together, these data provide new insights into MPNST signaling deregulation and suggest that co-targeting of <mark>PAK1/2/3</mark> and <mark>MEK1/2</mark> may be effective in the treatment of patients with MPNSTs.
Defective <mark>Hand1</mark> phosphoregulation uncovers essential roles for <mark>Hand1</mark> in limb morphogenesis.
The morphogenesis of the vertebrate limbs is a complex process in which cell signaling and transcriptional regulation coordinate diverse structural adaptations in diverse species.
In this study, we examine the consequences of altering <mark>Hand1</mark> dimer choice regulation within developing vertebrate limbs.
Although <mark>Hand1</mark> deletion via the limb-specific <mark>Prrx1</mark>-Cre reveals a non-essential role for <mark>Hand1</mark> in mouse limb morphogenesis, altering <mark>Hand1</mark> phosphoregulation, and consequently <mark>Hand1</mark> dimerization affinities, results in a severe truncation of proximal-anterior limb elements.
Molecular analysis reveals a non-cell-autonomous mechanism that causes widespread cell death within the embryonic limb bud.
In addition, we observe changes in proximal-anterior gene regulation, including a reduction in the expression of <mark>Irx3</mark>, <mark>Irx5</mark>, <mark>Gli3</mark> and <mark>Alx4</mark>, all of which are upregulated in <mark>Hand2</mark> limb conditional knockouts.
A reduction of <mark>Hand2</mark> and <mark>Shh</mark> gene dosage improves the integrity of anterior limb structures, validating the importance of the <mark>Twist</mark>-family bHLH dimer pool in limb morphogenesis.
Autophagy suppresses <mark>Ras</mark>-driven epithelial tumourigenesis by limiting the accumulation of reactive oxygen species.
Activation of <mark>Ras</mark> signalling occurs in ~30% of human cancers; however, activated <mark>Ras</mark> alone is not sufficient for tumourigenesis.
In a screen for tumour suppressors that cooperate with oncogenic <mark>Ras</mark> (<mark>Ras(V12)</mark>) in Drosophila, we identified genes involved in the autophagy pathway.
Bioinformatic analysis of human tumours revealed that several core autophagy genes, including <mark>GABARAP</mark>, correlate with oncogenic <mark>KRAS</mark> mutations and poor prognosis in human pancreatic cancer, supporting a potential tumour-suppressive effect of the pathway in <mark>Ras</mark>-driven human cancers.
In Drosophila, we demonstrate that blocking autophagy at any step of the pathway enhances <mark>Ras(V12)</mark>-driven epithelial tissue overgrowth via the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and activation of the <mark>Jun kinase</mark> stress response pathway.
Blocking autophagy in <mark>Ras(V12)</mark> clones also results in non-cell-autonomous effects with autophagy, cell proliferation and caspase activation induced in adjacent wild-type cells.
Our study has implications for understanding the interplay between perturbations in <mark>Ras</mark> signalling and autophagy in tumourigenesis, which might inform the development of novel therapeutics targeting <mark>Ras</mark>-driven cancers.

Mutations in <mark>N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase</mark> in patients with X-linked intellectual disability.
<mark>N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase</mark> (<mark>OGT</mark>) regulates protein O-GlcNAcylation, an essential and dynamic post-translational modification.
The O-GlcNAc modification is present on numerous nuclear and cytosolic proteins and has been implicated in essential cellular functions such as signaling and gene expression.
Accordingly, altered levels of protein O-GlcNAcylation have been associated with developmental defects and neurodegeneration.
However, mutations in the <mark>OGT</mark> gene have not yet been functionally confirmed in humans.
Here, we report on two hemizygous mutations in <mark>OGT</mark> in individuals with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and dysmorphic features: one missense mutation (p.Arg284Pro) and one mutation leading to a splicing defect (c.463-6T>G).
Both mutations reside in the tetratricopeptide repeats of <mark>OGT</mark> that are essential for substrate recognition.
We observed slightly reduced levels of <mark>OGT</mark> protein and reduced levels of its opposing enzyme <mark>O-GlcNAcase</mark> in both patient-derived fibroblasts, but global O-GlcNAc levels appeared to be unaffected.
Our data suggest that mutant cells attempt to maintain global O-GlcNAcylation by down-regulating <mark>O-GlcNAcase</mark> expression.
We also found that the c.463-6T>G mutation leads to aberrant mRNA splicing, but no stable truncated protein was detected in the corresponding patient-derived fibroblasts.
Recombinant <mark>OGT</mark> bearing the p.Arg284Pro mutation was prone to unfolding and exhibited reduced glycosylation activity against a complex array of glycosylation substrates and proteolytic processing of the transcription factor <mark>host cell factor 1</mark>, which is also encoded by an XLID-associated gene.
We conclude that defects in O-GlcNAc homeostasis and <mark>host cell factor 1</mark> proteolysis may play roles in mediation of XLID in individuals with <mark>OGT</mark> mutations.
Dynamic subunit turnover in <mark>ESCRT-III</mark> assemblies is regulated by <mark>Vps4</mark> to mediate membrane remodelling during cytokinesis.
The <mark>endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III</mark
> mediates membrane fission in fundamental cellular processes, including cytokinesis.
<mark>ESCRT-III</mark> is thought to form persistent filaments that over time increase their curvature to constrict membranes.
Unexpectedly, we found that <mark>ESCRT-III</mark> at the midbody of human cells rapidly turns over subunits with cytoplasmic pools while gradually forming larger assemblies.
<mark>ESCRT-III</mark> turnover depended on the <mark>ATPase</mark> <mark>VPS4</mark>, which accumulated at the midbody simultaneously with <mark>ESCRT-III</mark> subunits, and was required for assembly of functional <mark>ESCRT-III</mark> structures.
In vitro, the <mark>Vps2</mark>/<mark>Vps24</mark> subunits of <mark>ESCRT-III</mark> formed side-by-side filaments with <mark>Snf7</mark> and inhibited further polymerization, but the growth inhibition was alleviated by the addition of <mark>Vps4</mark> and ATP.
High-speed atomic force microscopy further revealed highly dynamic arrays of growing and shrinking <mark>ESCRT-III</mark> spirals in the presence of <mark>Vps4</mark>.
Continuous <mark>ESCRT-III</mark> remodelling by subunit turnover might facilitate shape adaptions to variable membrane geometries, with broad implications for diverse cellular processes.
<mark>MicroRNA-20a</mark>-mediated loss of autophagy contributes to breast tumorigenesis by promoting genomic damage and instability.
Gene expression analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer data set show that <mark>miR-20a</mark> is upregulated in human breast cancer, especially in triple-negative subtype.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis suggests that <mark>miR-20a</mark> expression negatively correlates with the autophagy/lysosome pathway.
We report here that <mark>miR-20a</mark> inhibits the basal and nutrient starvation-induced autophagic flux and lysosomal proteolytic activity, increases intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and DNA damage response by targeting several key regulators of autophagy, including <mark>BECN1</mark>, <mark>ATG16L1</mark> and <mark>SQSTM1</mark>.
Re-introduction of exogenous <mark>BECN1</mark>, <mark>ATG16L1</mark> or <mark>SQSTM1</mark> reverses the inhibitory effect of <mark>miR-20a</mark> on autophagy and decreases DNA damage.
A negative correlation between <mark>miR-20a</mark> and its target genes is observed in breast cancer tissues.
Lower levels of <mark>BECN1</mark>, <mark>ATG16L1</mark> and <mark>SQSTM1</mark> are more common in triple-negative cancers than in other subtypes.
High levels of <mark>miR-20a</mark> also associate with higher frequency of copy-number alterations and DNA mutations in breast cancer patients.
Further studies in a xenograft mouse model show that <mark>miR-20a</mark> promotes tumor initiation and tumor growth.
Collectively, these findings suggest that <mark>miR-20a</mark>-mediated autophagy defect might be a new mechanism underlying the oncogenic function of miRNA during breast tumorigenesis.

Genome-wide loss-of-function genetic screening identifies <mark>opioid receptor μ1</mark> as a key regulator of L-asparaginase resistance in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
L-asparaginase is a critical chemotherapeutic agent for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
It hydrolyzes plasma asparagine into aspartate and NH3, causing asparagine deficit and inhibition of protein synthesis and eventually, leukemic cell death.
However, patient relapse often occurs due to development of resistance.
The molecular mechanism by which ALL cells acquire resistance to L-asparaginase is unknown.
Therefore, we sought to identify genes that are involved in L-asparaginase resistance in primary leukemic cells.
By unbiased genome-wide RNAi screening, we found that among 10 resistant ALL clones, six hits were for <mark>opioid receptor mu 1</mark> (<mark>oprm1</mark>), two hits were for <mark>carbonic anhydrase 1</mark> (<mark>ca1</mark>) and another two hits were for <mark>ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C</mark> (<mark>ube2c</mark>).
We also found that <mark>OPRM1</mark> is expressed in all leukemic cells tested.
Specific knockdown of <mark>OPRM1</mark> confers L-asparaginase resistance, validating our genome-wide retroviral shRNA library screening data.
Methadone, an agonist of <mark>OPRM1</mark>, enhances the sensitivity of parental leukemic cells, but not <mark>OPRM1</mark>-depleted cells, to L-asparaginase treatment, indicating that <mark>OPRM1</mark> is required for the synergistic action of L-asparaginase and methadone, and that <mark>OPRM1</mark> loss promotes leukemic cell survival likely through downregulation of the <mark>OPRM1</mark>-mediated apoptotic pathway.
Consistent with this premise, patient leukemic cells with relatively high levels of <mark>OPRM1</mark> are more sensitive to L-asparaginase treatment compared to <mark>OPRM1</mark>-depleted leukemic cells, further indicating that <mark>OPRM1</mark> loss has a crucial role in L-asparaginase resistance in leukemic patients.
Thus, our study demonstrates for the first time, a novel <mark>OPRM1</mark>-mediated mechanism for L-asparaginase resistance in ALL, and identifies <mark>OPRM1</mark> as a functional biomarker for defining high-risk subpopulations and for the detection of evolving resistant clones.
<mark>Oprm1</mark> may also be utilized for effective treatment of L-asparaginase-resistant ALL.Oncogene advance online publication, 26 June 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.211.
Discovery of long-range inhibitory signaling to ensure single axon formation.
A long-standing question in neurodevelopment is how neurons develop a single axon and multiple dendrites from common immature neurites.
Long-range inhibitory signaling from the growing axon is hypothesized to prevent outgrowth of other immature neurites and to differentiate them into dendrites, but the existence and nature of this inhibitory signaling remains unknown.
Here, we demonstrate that axonal growth triggered by <mark>neurotrophin-3</mark> remotely inhibits neurite outgrowth through long-range Ca(2+) waves, which are delivered from the growing axon to the cell body.
These Ca(2+) waves increase <mark>RhoA</mark> activity in the cell body through <mark>calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I</mark>.
Optogenetic control of <mark>Rho-kinase</mark> combined with computational modeling reveals that active <mark>Rho-kinase</mark> diffuses to growing other immature neurites and inhibits their outgrowth.
Mechanistically, <mark>calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I</mark> phosphorylates a <mark>RhoA</mark>-specific <mark>GEF</mark>, <mark>GEF-H1</mark>, whose phosphorylation enhances its <mark>GEF</mark> activity.
Thus, our results reveal that long-range inhibitory signaling mediated by Ca(2+) wave is responsible for neuronal polarization.
Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota influences immune function in the brain and may play a role in neurological diseases.
Here, the authors offer in vivo evidence from a Drosophila model that supports a role for gut microbiota in modulating the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
<mark>Angiotensin II subtype 1a receptor</mark> signaling in resident hepatic macrophages induces liver metastasis formation.
Liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) are a clinically significant problem.
The <mark>renin</mark>-<mark>angiotensin</mark> system is involved in tumor growth and metastases.
This study was designed to evaluate the role of <mark>angiotensin II subtype receptor 1a</mark> (<mark>AT1a</mark>) in the formation of liver metastasis in CRC.
A model of liver metastasis was developed by intrasplenic injection of mouse colon cancer (CMT-93) into <mark>AT1a</mark> knockout mice (AT1aKO) and wild-type (C57BL/6) mice (WT).
Compared with WT mice, the liver weight and liver metastatic rate were significantly lower in AT1aKO.
The mRNA levels of <mark>CD31</mark>, <mark>transforming growth factor- b1</mark> (<mark>TGF-b1</mark>), and <mark>F4/80</mark> were suppressed in AT1aKO compared with WT.
Double immunofluorescence analysis showed that the number of accumulated <mark>F4/80</mark>(+) cells expressing <mark>TGF-b1</mark> in metastatic areas was higher in WT than in AT1aKO.
The AT1aKO bone marrow (BM) (AT1aKO-BM)→WT showed suppressed formation of liver metastasis compared with WT-BM→WT.
However, the formation of metastasis was further suppressed in WT-BM→AT1aKO compared with AT1aKO-BM→WT.
In addition, accumulated <mark>F4/80</mark>(+) cells in the liver metastasis were not BM-derived <mark>F4/80</mark>(+) cells, but mainly resident hepatic <mark>F4/80</mark>(+) cells, and these resident hepatic <mark>F4/80</mark>(+) cells were positive for <mark>TGF-b1</mark>.
<mark>Angiotensin II</mark> enhanced <mark>TGF-b1</mark> expression in Kupffer cells.
Treatment of WT with clodronate liposomes suppressed liver metastasis by diminishing <mark>TGF-b1</mark>(+) <mark>F4/80</mark>(+) cells accumulation.
The formation of liver metastasis correlated with collagen deposition in the metastatic area, which was dependent on <mark>AT1a</mark> signaling.
These results suggested that resident hepatic macrophages induced liver metastasis formation by induction of <mark>TGF-b1</mark> through <mark>AT1a</mark> signaling.
A Type 2 Diabetes-Associated Functional Regulatory Variant in a Pancreatic Islet Enhancer at the <mark>ADCY5</mark> Locus.
Molecular mechanisms remain unknown for most type 2 diabetes genome-wide association study identified loci.
Variants associated with type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose levels reside in introns of <mark>ADCY5</mark>, a gene that encodes <mark>adenylate cyclase 5</mark>.
<mark>Adenylate cyclase 5</mark> catalyzes the production of cyclic AMP, which is a second messenger molecule involved in cell signaling and pancreatic β-cell <mark>insulin</mark> secretion.
We demonstrated that type 2 diabetes risk alleles are associated with decreased <mark>ADCY5</mark> expression in human islets and examined candidate variants for regulatory function.
rs11708067 overlaps a predicted enhancer region in pancreatic islets.
The type 2 diabetes risk rs11708067-A allele showed fewer <mark>H3</mark>K27ac ChIP-seq reads in human islets, lower transcriptional activity in reporter assays in rodent β-cells (rat 832/13 and mouse MIN6), and increased nuclear protein binding compared with the rs11708067-G allele.
Homozygous deletion of the orthologous enhancer region in 832/13 cells resulted in a 64% reduction in expression level of <mark>Adcy5</mark>, but not adjacent gene <mark>Sec22a</mark>, and a 39% reduction in <mark>insulin</mark> secretion.
Together, these data suggest that rs11708067-A risk allele contributes to type 2 diabetes by disrupting an islet enhancer, which results in reduced <mark>ADCY5</mark> expression and impaired <mark>insulin</mark> secretion.
Mutation of the <mark>α-tubulin</mark> <mark>Tuba1a</mark> leads to straighter microtubules and perturbs neuronal migration.
Brain development involves extensive migration of neurons.
Microtubules (MTs) are key cellular effectors of neuronal displacement that are assembled from <mark>α/β-tubulin</mark> heterodimers.
Mutation of the <mark>α-tubulin</mark> isotype <mark>TUBA1A</mark> is associated with cortical malformations in humans.
In this study, we provide detailed in vivo and in vitro analyses of <mark>Tuba1a</mark> mutants.
In mice carrying a <mark>Tuba1a</mark> missense mutation (S140G), neurons accumulate, and glial cells are dispersed along the rostral migratory stream in postnatal and adult brains.
Live imaging of <mark>Tuba1a</mark>-mutant neurons revealed slowed migration and increased neuronal branching, which correlated with directionality alterations and perturbed nucleus-centrosome (N-C) coupling.
<mark>Tuba1a</mark> mutation led to increased straightness of newly polymerized MTs, and structural modeling data suggest a conformational change in the <mark>α/β-tubulin</mark> heterodimer.
We show that <mark>Tuba8</mark>, another <mark>α-tubulin</mark> isotype previously associated with cortical malformations, has altered function compared with <mark>Tuba1a</mark>.
Our work shows that <mark>Tuba1a</mark> plays an essential, noncompensated role in neuronal saltatory migration in vivo and highlights the importance of MT flexibility in N-C coupling and neuronal-branching regulation during neuronal migration.
<mark>Prdm1</mark> Regulates Thymic Epithelial Function To Prevent Autoimmunity.
Autoimmunity is largely prevented by medullary thymic epithelial cells (TECs) through their expression and presentation of tissue-specific Ags to developing thymocytes, resulting in deletion of self-reactive T cells and supporting regulatory T cell development.
The <mark>transcription factor</mark> <mark>Prdm1</mark> has been implicated in autoimmune diseases in humans through genome-wide association studies and in mice using cell type-specific deletion of <mark>Prdm1</mark> in T and dendritic cells.
In this article, we demonstrate that <mark>Prdm1</mark> functions in TECs to prevent autoimmunity in mice.
<mark>Prdm1</mark> is expressed by a subset of mouse TECs, and conditional deletion of <mark>Prdm1</mark> in either <mark>Keratin 14</mark>- or <mark>Foxn1</mark>-expressing cells in mice resulted in multisymptom autoimmune pathology.
Notably, the development of <mark>Foxp3</mark>(+) regulatory T cells occurs normally in the absence of <mark>Blimp1</mark>.
Importantly, nude mice developed anti-nuclear Abs when transplanted with <mark>Prdm1</mark> null TECs, but not wild-type TECs, indicating that <mark>Prdm1</mark> functions in TECs to regulate autoantibody production.
We show that <mark>Prdm1</mark> acts independently of <mark>Aire</mark>, a crucial <mark>transcription factor</mark> implicated in medullary TEC function.
Collectively, our data highlight a previously unrecognized role for <mark>Prdm1</mark> in regulating thymic epithelial function.
A single amino acid substitution confers B-cell clonogenic activity to the HIV-1 <mark>matrix <mark>matrix protein p17</ma<mark>p17</mark>.
Recent data highlight the presence, in HIV-1-seropositive patients with lymphoma, of <mark>p17</mark> variants (v<mark>p17</mark>s) endowed with B-cell clonogenicity, suggesting a role of v<mark>p17</mark>s in lymphomagenesis.
We investigated the mechanisms responsible for the functional disparity on B cells between a wild-type <mark>p17</mark> (ref<mark>p17</mark>) and a v<mark>p17</mark> named S75X.
Here, we show that a single Arginine (R) to Glycine (G) mutation at position 76 in the ref<mark>p17</mark> backbone (<mark>p17</mark>R76G), as in the S75X variant, is per se sufficient to confer a B-cell clonogenic potential to the viral protein and modulate, through activation of the <mark>PTEN</mark>/<mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> signaling pathway, different molecules involved in apoptosis inhibition (<mark>CASP-9</mark>, <mark>CASP-7</mark>, <mark>DFF-45</mark>, <mark>NPM</mark>, <mark>YWHAZ</mark>, <mark>Src</mark>, <mark>PAX2</mark>, <mark>MAPK8</mark>), cell cycle promotion and cancer progression (<mark>CDK1</mark>, <mark>CDK2</mark>, <mark>CDK8</mark>, <mark>CHEK1</mark>, <mark>CHEK2</mark>, <mark>GSK-3 beta</mark>, <mark>NPM</mark>, <mark>PAK1</mark>, <mark>PP2C-alpha</mark>).
Moreover, the only R to G mutation at position 76 was found to strongly impact on protein folding and oligomerization by altering the hydrogen bond network.
This generates a conformational shift in the <mark>p17</mark> R76G mutant which enables a functional epitope(s), masked in ref<mark>p17</mark>, to elicit B-cell growth-promoting signals after its interaction with a still unknown receptor(s).
Our findings offer new opportunities to understand the molecular mechanisms accounting for the B-cell growth-promoting activity of v<mark>p17</mark>s.
<mark>TPL-2</mark> restricts <mark>Ccl24</mark>-dependent immunity to Heligmosomoides polygyrus.
<mark>TPL-2</mark> (<mark>COT</mark>, <mark>MAP3K8</mark>) kinase activates the <mark>MEK1/2</mark>-<mark>ERK1/2</mark> <mark>MAPK</mark> signaling pathway in innate immune responses following <mark>TLR</mark>, <mark>TNFR1</mark> and <mark>IL-1R</mark> stimulation.
<mark>TPL-2</mark> contributes to type-1/Th17-mediated autoimmunity and control of intracellular pathogens.
We recently demonstrated <mark>TPL-2</mark> reduces severe airway allergy to house dust mite by negatively regulating type-2 responses.
In the present study, we found that <mark>TPL-2</mark> deficiency resulted in resistance to Heligmosomoides polygyrus infection, with accelerated worm expulsion, reduced fecal egg burden and reduced worm fitness.
Using co-housing experiments, we found resistance to infection in <mark>TPL-2</mark> deficient mice (<mark>Map3k8</mark>-/-) was independent of microbiota alterations in H. polygyrus infected WT and <mark>Map3k8</mark>-/-mice.
Additionally, our data demonstrated immunity to H. polygyrus infection in <mark>TPL-2</mark> deficient mice was not due to dysregulated type-2 immune responses.
Genome-wide analysis of intestinal tissue from infected <mark>TPL-2</mark>-deficient mice identified elevated expression of genes involved in chemotaxis and homing of leukocytes and cells, including <mark>Ccl24</mark> and alternatively activated genes.
Indeed, <mark>Map3k8</mark>-/-mice had a significant influx of eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes and Il4GFP+ T cells.
Conditional knockout experiments demonstrated that specific deletion of <mark>TPL-2</mark> in <mark>CD11c</mark>+ cells, but not <mark>Villin</mark>+ epithelial cells, <mark>LysM</mark>+ myeloid cells or <mark>CD4</mark>+ T cells, led to accelerated resistance to H. polygyrus.
In line with a central role of <mark>CD11c</mark>+ cells, <mark>CD11c</mark>+ <mark>CD11b</mark>+ cells isolated from <mark>TPL-2</mark>-deficient mice had elevated <mark>Ccl24</mark>.
Finally, <mark>Ccl24</mark> neutralization in <mark>TPL-2</mark> deficient mice significantly decreased the expression of <mark>Arg1</mark>, <mark>Retnla</mark>, <mark>Chil3</mark> and <mark>Ear11</mark> correlating with a loss of resistance to H. polygyrus.
These observations suggest that <mark>TPL-2</mark>-regulated <mark>Ccl24</mark> in <mark>CD11c</mark>+<mark>CD11b</mark>+ cells prevents accelerated type-2 mediated immunity to H. polygyrus.
Collectively, this study identifies a previously unappreciated role for <mark>TPL-2</mark> controlling immune responses to H. polygyrus infection by restricting <mark>Ccl24</mark> production.
<mark>Gankyrin</mark> induces <mark>STAT3</mark> activation in tumor microenvironment and sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma.
Most hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) develop as a result of chronic liver inflammation.
We have shown that the <mark>oncoprotein</mark> <mark>gankyrin</mark> is critical for inflammation-induced tumorigenesis in the colon.
Although the in vitro function of <mark>gankyrin</mark> is well known, its role in vivo remains to be elucidated.
We investigated the effect of <mark>gankyrin</mark> in the tumor microenvironment of mice with liver parenchymal cell-specific <mark>gankyrin</mark> ablation (<mark>Alb</mark>-Cre;<mark>gankyrin</mark>(f/f) ) and <mark>gankyrin</mark> deletion both in liver parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells (Mx1-Cre;<mark>gankyrin</mark>(f/f) ).
<mark>Gankyrin</mark> upregulates <mark>vascular endothelial growth factor</mark> expression in tumor cells.
<mark>Gankyrin</mark> binds to <mark>Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1</mark> (<mark>SHP-1</mark>), mainly expressed in liver non-parenchymal cells, resulting in phosphorylation and activation of <mark>signal transducer and activator of transcription 3</mark> (<mark>STAT3</mark>).
<mark>Gankyrin</mark> deficiency in non-parenchymal cells, but not in parenchymal cells, reduced <mark>STAT3</mark> activity, <mark>interleukin (IL)-6</mark> production, and cancer stem cell marker (<mark>Bmi1</mark> and <mark>epithelial cell adhesion molecule</mark> [<mark>EpCAM</mark>]) expression, leading to attenuated tumorigenic potential.
Chronic inflammation enhances <mark>gankyrin</mark> expression in the human liver.
<mark>Gankyrin</mark> expression in the tumor microenvironment is negatively correlated with progression-free survival in patients undergoing sorafenib treatment for HCC.
Thus, <mark>gankyrin</mark> appears to play a critical oncogenic function in tumor microenvironment and may be a potential target for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies against HCC.
Monoallelic characteristic-bearing heterozygous L1053X in <mark>BRCA2</mark> gene among Sudanese women with breast cancer.
BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common type of cancer in women.
Among many risk factors of BC, mutations in <mark>BRCA2</mark> gene were found to be the primary cause in 5-10% of cases.
The majority of deleterious mutations are frameshift or nonsense mutations.
Most of the reported <mark>BRCA2</mark> mutations are protein truncating mutations.
METHODS: The study aimed to describe the pattern of mutations including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and variants of the <mark>BRCA2</mark> (exon11) gene among Sudanese women patients diagnosed with BC.
In this study a specific region of <mark>BRCA2</mark> exon 11 was targeted using PCR and DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Early onset cases 25/45 (55.6%) were premenopausal women with a mean age of 36.6 years.
Multiparity was more frequent within the study amounting to 30 cases (66.6%), with a mean parity of 4.1.
Ductal type tumor was the predominant type detected in 22 cases (48.8%) among the reported histotypes.
A heterozygous monoallelic nonsense mutation at nucleotide 3385 was found in four patients out of 9, where TTA codon was converted into the stop codon TGA.
CONCLUSION: This study detected a monoallelic nonsense mutation in four Sudanese female patients diagnosed with early onset BC from different families.
Further work is needed to demonstrate its usefulness in screening of BC.
<mark>Pet10p</mark> is a yeast <mark>perilipin</mark> that stabilizes lipid droplets and promotes their assembly.
<mark>Pet10p</mark> is a yeast <mark>lipid droplet protein</mark> of unknown function.
We show that it binds specifically to and is stabilized by droplets containing triacylglycerol (TG).
Droplets isolated from cells with a <mark>PET10</mark> deletion strongly aggregate, appear fragile, and fuse in vivo when cells are cultured in oleic acid.
<mark>Pet10p</mark> binds early to nascent droplets, and their rate of appearance is decreased in pet10Δ Moreover, <mark>Pet10p</mark> functionally interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum droplet assembly factors <mark>seipin</mark> and <mark>Fit2</mark> to maintain proper droplet morphology.
The activity of <mark>Dga1p</mark>, a <mark>diacylglycerol acyltransferase</mark>, and TG accumulation were both 30-35% lower in the absence of <mark>Pet10p</mark>.
<mark>Pet10p</mark> contains a PAT domain, a defining property of perilipins, which was not previously known to exist in yeast.
We propose that the core functions of <mark>Pet10p</mark> and other <mark>perilipins</mark> extend beyond protection from lipases and include the preservation of droplet integrity as well as collaboration with <mark>seipin</mark> and <mark>Fit2</mark> in droplet assembly and maintenance.
<mark>A20</mark> Restrains Thymic Regulatory T Cell Development.
Maintaining immune tolerance requires the production of <mark>Foxp3</mark>-expressing regulatory T (Treg) cells in the thymus.
Activation of <mark>NF-κB</mark> transcription factors is critically required for Treg cell development, partly via initiating <mark>Foxp3</mark> expression.
<mark>NF-κB</mark> activation is controlled by a negative feedback regulation through the ubiquitin editing enzyme <mark>A20</mark>, which reduces proinflammatory signaling in myeloid cells and B cells.
In naive <mark>CD4</mark>(+) T cells, <mark>A20</mark> prevents kinase <mark>RIPK3</mark>-dependent necroptosis.
Using mice deficient for <mark>A20</mark> in T lineage cells, we show that thymic and peripheral Treg cell compartments are quantitatively enlarged because of a cell-intrinsic developmental advantage of <mark>A20</mark>-deficient thymic Treg differentiation.
<mark>A20</mark>-deficient thymic Treg cells exhibit reduced dependence on <mark>IL-2</mark> but unchanged rates of proliferation and apoptosis.
Activation of the <mark>NF-κB</mark> transcription factor <mark>RelA</mark> was enhanced, whereas nuclear translocation of <mark>c-Rel</mark> was decreased in <mark>A20</mark>-deficient thymic Treg cells.
Furthermore, we found that the increase in Treg cells in T cell-specific <mark>A20</mark>-deficient mice was already observed in <mark>CD4</mark>(+) single-positive <mark>CD25</mark>(+) <mark>GITR</mark>(+) <mark>Foxp3</mark>(-) thymic Treg cell progenitors.
Treg cell precursors expressed high levels of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily molecule <mark>GITR</mark>, whose stimulation is closely linked to thymic Treg cell development.
<mark>A20</mark>-deficient Treg cells efficiently suppressed effector T cell-mediated graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, suggesting normal suppressive function.
Holding thymic production of natural Treg cells in check, <mark>A20</mark> thus integrates Treg cell activity and increased effector T cell survival into an efficient <mark>CD4</mark>(+) T cell response.
<mark>Interleukin 6</mark> (<mark>IL-6</mark>) and <mark>Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha</mark> (<mark>TNF-alpha</mark>) Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), Inflammation and Metabolism in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Inner Mongolia.
BACKGROUND Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is common all over the world.
GDM women are with inflammatory and metabolisms abnormalities.
However, few studies have focused on the association of <mark>IL-6</mark>5-72C/G and <mark>TNF-alpha</mark> -857C/T single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), inflammatory biomarkers, and metabolic indexes in women with GDM, especially in the Inner Mongolia population.
The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of <mark>IL-6</mark>5-72C/G and <mark>TNF-alpha</mark> -857C/T SNPs, and inflammation and metabolic biomarkers in women with GDM pregnancies.
MATERIAL AND METHODS Blood samples and placentas from 140 women with GDM and 140 women with healthy pregnancies were collected.
Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and MassARRAY-IPLEX were performed to analyze <mark>IL-6</mark>5-72C/G and <mark>TNF-alpha</mark> -857C/T SNPs.
Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to analyze inflammatory biomarkers and <mark>adipokines</mark>.
RESULTS Distribution frequency of <mark>TNF-alpha</mark> -857CT (OR=3.316, 95% CI=1.092-8.304, p=0.025) in women with GDM pregnancies were obviously higher than that in women with healthy pregnancies.
Women with GDM were of older maternal age, had higher BMI, were more nulliparous, and had T2DM and GDM history, compared to women with healthy pregnancies (p&lt;0.05).
Inflammatory biomarkers in serum (hs-<mark>CRP</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-8</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>/<mark>IL-10</mark> ratio) and placental (<mark>NF-kappaB</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-8</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>/<mark>IL-10</mark> ratio, <mark>IL-1b</mark>, <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>) were significantly different (p&lt;0.05) between women with GDM and women with healthy pregnancies.
Differences were found for serum FBG, FINS, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-beta, and placental <mark>IRS-1</mark>, <mark>IRS-2</mark>, <mark>leptin</mark>, <mark>adiponectin</mark>, <mark>visfatin</mark>, <mark>RBP-4</mark>, <mark>chemerin</mark>, <mark>nesfatin-1</mark>, <mark>FATP-4</mark>, <mark>EL</mark>, <mark>LPL</mark>, <mark>FABP-1</mark>, <mark>FABP-3</mark>, <mark>FABP-4</mark>, and <mark>FABP-5</mark>.
CONCLUSIONS <mark>TNF-alpha</mark> -857C/T SNP, hs-<mark>CRP</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-8</mark>, and <mark>IL-6</mark>/<mark>IL-10</mark> were associated with GDM in women from Inner Mongolia, as was serious inflammation and disordered lipid and glucose metabolisms.
An <mark>Aγ-globin</mark> G->A gene polymorphism associated with <mark>β(0)39 thalassemia globin</mark> gene and high <mark>fetal hemoglobin</mark> production.
BACKGROUND: Increase of the expression of <mark>γ-globin</mark> gene and high production of <mark>fetal hemoglobin</mark> (<mark>HbF</mark>) in β-thalassemia patients is widely accepted as associated with a milder or even asymptomatic disease.
The search for <mark>HbF</mark>-associated polymorphisms (such as the XmnI, <mark>BCL11A</mark> and <mark>MYB</mark> polymorphisms) has recently gained great attention, in order to stratify β-thalassemia patients with respect to expectancy of the first transfusion, need for annual intake of blood, response to <mark>HbF</mark> inducers (the most studied of which is hydroxyurea).
METHODS: <mark>Aγ-globin</mark> gene sequencing was performed on genomic DNA isolated from a total of 75 β-thalassemia patients, including 31 β(0)39/β(0)39, 33 β(0)39/β(+)IVSI-110, 9 β(+)IVSI-110/β(+)IVSI-110, one β(0)IVSI-1/β(+)IVSI-6 and one β(0)39/β(+)IVSI-6.
RESULTS: The results show that the rs368698783 polymorphism is present in β-thalassemia patients in the 5'UTR sequence (+25) of the <mark>Aγ-globin</mark> gene, known to affect the <mark>LYAR</mark> (human homologue of mouse <mark>Ly-1 antibody reactive clone</mark>) binding site 5'-GGTTAT-3'.
This Aγ(+25 G->A) polymorphism is associated with the <mark>Gγ-globin</mark>-XmnI polymorphism and both are linked with the <mark>β(0)39-globin</mark> gene, but not with the <mark>β(+)IVSI-110-globin</mark> gene.
In agreement with the expectation that this mutation alters the <mark>LYAR</mark> binding activity, we found that the <mark>Aγ(+25 G->A) and Gγ-globin</mark>-XmnI polymorphisms are associated with high <mark>HbF</mark> in erythroid precursor cells isolated from β(0)39/β(0)39 thalassemia patients.
CONCLUSIONS: As a potential explanation of our findings, we hypothesize that in β-thalassemia the <mark>Gγ-globin</mark>-XmnI/<mark>Aγ-globin</mark>-(G->A) genotype is frequently under genetic linkage with β(0)-thalassemia mutations, but not with the β(+)-thalassemia mutation here studied (i.e. β(+)IVSI-110) and that this genetic combination has been selected within the population of β(0)-thalassemia patients, due to functional association with high <mark>HbF</mark>.
Here we describe the characterization of the rs368698783 (+25 G->A) polymorphism of the <mark>Aγ-globin</mark> gene associated in β(0)39 thalassemia patients with high <mark>HbF</mark> in erythroid precursor cells.
Intrauterine growth retardation promotes fetal intestinal autophagy in rats via the <mark>mechanistic target of rapamycin</mark> pathway.
Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) impairs fetal intestinal development, and is associated with high perinatal morbidity and mortality.
However, the mechanism underlying this intestinal injury is largely unknown.
We aimed to investigate this mechanism through analysis of intestinal autophagy and related signaling pathways in a rat model of IUGR.
Normal weight (NW) and IUGR fetuses were obtained from primiparous rats via ad libitum food intake and 50% food restriction, respectively.
Maternal serum parameters, fetal body weight, organ weights, and fetal blood glucose were determined.
Intestinal apoptosis, autophagy, and the <mark>mechanistic target of rapamycin</mark> (<mark>mTOR</mark>) signaling pathway were analyzed.
The results indicated that maternal 50% food restriction reduced maternal serum glucose, bilirubin, and total cholesterol and produced IUGR fetuses, which had decreased body weight; blood glucose; and weights of the small intestine, stomach, spleen, pancreas, and kidney.
Decreased <mark>Bcl-2</mark> and increased <mark>Casp9</mark> mRNA expression was observed in IUGR fetal intestines.
Analysis of intestinal autophagy showed that the mRNA expression of <mark>WIPI1</mark>, <mark>MAP1LC3B</mark>, <mark>Atg5</mark>, and <mark>Atg14</mark> was also increased, while the protein levels of <mark>p62</mark> were decreased in IUGR fetuses.
Compared to NW fetuses, IUGR fetuses showed decreased <mark>mTOR</mark> protein levels and enhanced mRNA expression of <mark>ULK1</mark> and <mark>Beclin1</mark> in the small intestine.
In summary, the results indicated that maternal 50% food restriction on gestational days 10-21 reduced maternal serum glucose, bilirubin, and total cholesterol contents, and produced IUGR fetuses that had low blood glucose and reduced small intestine weight.
Intestinal injury of IUGR fetuses caused by maternal food restriction might be due to enhanced apoptosis and autophagy via the <mark>mTOR</mark> signaling pathway.
Peptide array based screening reveals a large number of proteins interacting with the ankyrin repeat domain of the <mark>zDHHC17</mark> <mark>S-acyltransferase</mark>.
<mark>zDHHC S-acyl-transferases</mark> are enzymes catalyzing protein S-acylation, a common post-translational modification on proteins frequently affecting their membrane targeting and trafficking.
The ankyrin-repeat (AR) domain of <mark>zDHHC17</mark> (<mark>HIP14</mark>) and <mark>zDHHC13</mark> (<mark>HIP14L</mark>) <mark>S-acyltransferases</mark>, which is involved in both substrate recruitment and S-acylation-independent functions, was recently shown to bind at least six proteins, by specific recognition of a consensus sequence in them.
To further refine the rules governing binding to the AR of <mark>zDHHC17</mark>, we employed peptide arrays based on zDHHC AR-binding motif (zDABM) sequences of <mark>synaptosomal-associated protein 25</mark> (<mark>SNAP25</mark>) and <mark>cysteine string protein alpha</mark> (<mark>CSPα</mark>).
Quantitative comparisons of the binding preferences of 400 peptides allowed us to construct a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) for <mark>zDHHC17</mark> AR binding, with which we predicted and subsequently validated many putative <mark>zDHHC17</mark> interactors.
We identified 95 human zDABM sequences with unexpected versatility in amino-acid usage; these sequences were distributed among 90 proteins, of which 62 have not been previously implicated in <mark>zDHHC17/13</mark> binding.
These zDABM-containing proteins included all family members of the <mark>SNAP25</mark>, sprouty, <mark>cornifelin</mark>, ankyrin, and SLAIN-motif containing families; seven endogenous <mark>Gag polyproteins</mark> sharing the same binding sequence; and several proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization, cell communication, and regulation of signaling.
A dozen of the zDABM-containing proteins had more than one zDABM sequence, while isoform-specific binding to the AR of <mark>zDHHC17</mark> was identified for the <mark>Ena/VASP-like protein</mark>.
The large number of zDABM sequences within the human proteome suggests that <mark>zDHHC17</mark> may be an interaction hub regulating many cellular processes.
<mark>Flavin monooxygenases</mark> regulate Caenorhabditis elegans axon guidance and growth cone protrusion with <mark>UNC-6</mark>/<mark>Netrin</mark> signaling and <mark>Rac GTPases</mark>.
The guidance cue <mark>UNC-6</mark>/<mark>Netrin</mark> regulates both attractive and repulsive axon guidance.
Our previous work showed that in C. elegans, the attractive <mark>UNC-6</mark>/<mark>Netrin receptor</mark> <mark>UNC-40</mark>/<mark>DCC</mark> stimulates growth cone protrusion, and that the repulsive receptor, an <mark>UNC-5</mark>:<mark>UNC-40</mark> heterodimer, inhibits growth cone protrusion.
We have also shown that inhibition of growth cone protrusion downstream of the <mark>UNC-5</mark>:<mark>UNC-40</mark> repulsive receptor involves <mark>Rac GTPases</mark>, the Rac GTP exchange factor <mark>UNC-73</mark>/<mark>Trio</mark>, and the cytoskeletal regulator <mark>UNC-33</mark>/<mark>CRMP</mark>, which mediates <mark>Semaphorin</mark>-induced growth cone collapse in other systems.
The multidomain <mark>flavoprotein monooxygenase</mark> (<mark>FMO</mark>) <mark>MICAL</mark> (<mark>Molecule Interacting with CasL</mark>) also mediates growth cone collapse in response to <mark>Semaphorin</mark> by directly oxidizing <mark>F-actin</mark>, resulting in depolymerization.
The C. elegans genome does not encode a multidomain <mark>MICAL</mark>-like molecule, but does encode five <mark>flavin monooxygenases</mark> (<mark>FMO-1, -2, -3, -4, and 5</mark>) and another molecule, <mark>EHBP-1</mark>, similar to the non-FMO portion of <mark>MICAL</mark>.
Here we show that <mark>FMO-1</mark>, <mark>FMO-4</mark>, <mark>FMO-5</mark>, and <mark>EHBP-1</mark> may play a role in <mark>UNC-6</mark>/<mark>Netrin</mark> directed repulsive guidance mediated through <mark>UNC-40</mark> and <mark>UNC-5</mark> receptors.
Mutations in <mark>fmo-1</mark>, <mark>fmo-4</mark>, <mark>fmo-5</mark>, and <mark>ehbp-1</mark> showed VD/DD axon guidance and branching defects, and variably enhanced <mark>unc-40</mark> and <mark>unc-5</mark> VD/DD axon guidance defects.
Developing growth cones in vivo of <mark>fmo-1</mark>, <mark>fmo-4</mark>, <mark>fmo-5</mark>, and <mark>ehbp-1</mark> mutants displayed excessive filopodial protrusion, and transgenic expression of <mark>FMO-5</mark> inhibited growth cone protrusion.
Mutations suppressed growth cone inhibition caused by activated <mark>UNC-40</mark> and <mark>UNC-5</mark> signaling, and activated <mark>Rac GTPase</mark> <mark>CED-10</mark> and <mark>MIG-2</mark>, suggesting that these molecules are required downstream of <mark>UNC-6/Netrin receptors</mark> and <mark>Rac GTPases</mark>.
From these studies we conclude that <mark>FMO-1</mark>, <mark>FMO-4</mark>, <mark>FMO-5</mark>, and <mark>EHBP-1</mark> represent new players downstream of <mark>UNC-6/Netrin receptors</mark> and <mark>Rac GTPases</mark> that inhibit growth cone filopodial protrusion in repulsive axon guidance.
Disease-associated mutations in human <mark>BICD2</mark> hyperactivate motility of <mark>dynein</mark>-<mark>dynactin</mark>.
<mark>Bicaudal D2</mark> (<mark>BICD2</mark>) joins <mark>dynein</mark> with <mark>dynactin</mark> into a ternary complex (termed <mark>DDB</mark>) capable of processive movement.
Point mutations in the <mark>BICD2</mark> gene have been identified in patients with a dominant form of spinal muscular atrophy, but how these mutations cause disease is unknown.
To investigate this question, we have developed in vitro motility assays with purified <mark>DDB</mark> and <mark>BICD2</mark>'s membrane vesicle partner, the <mark>GTPase Rab6a</mark>.
<mark>Rab6a</mark>-GTP, either in solution or bound to artificial liposomes, released <mark>BICD2</mark> from an autoinhibited state and promoted robust <mark>dynein</mark>-<mark>dynactin</mark> transport.
In these assays, <mark>BICD2</mark> mutants showed an enhanced ability to form motile <mark>DDB</mark> complexes.
Increased retrograde transport by <mark>BICD2</mark> mutants also was observed in cells using an inducible organelle transport assay.
When overexpressed in rat hippocampal neurons, the hyperactive <mark>BICD2</mark> mutants decreased neurite growth.
Our results reveal that dominant mutations in <mark>BICD2</mark> hyperactivate <mark>DDB</mark> motility and suggest that an imbalance of minus versus plus end-directed microtubule motility in neurons may underlie spinal muscular atrophy.
Functional divergence of chloroplast <mark>Cpn60α<<mark>Cpn60α subunits</mark> during Arabidopsis embryo development.
<mark>Chaperonins</mark> are a class of <mark>molecular chaperones</mark> that assist in the folding and assembly of a wide range of substrates.
In plants, chloroplast <mark>chaperonins</mark> are composed of two different types of subunits, <mark>Cpn60α</mark> and <mark>Cpn60β</mark>, and duplication of <mark>Cpn60α</mark> and <mark>Cpn60β</mark> genes occurs in a high proportion of plants.
However, the importance of multiple <mark>Cpn60α</mark> and <mark>Cpn60β</mark> genes in plants is poorly understood.
In this study, we found that loss-of-function of <mark>CPNA2</mark> (<mark>AtCpn60α2</mark>), a gene encoding the <mark>minor Cpn60α subunit</mark> in Arabidopsis thaliana, resulted in arrested embryo development at the globular stage, whereas the other <mark>AtCpn60α</mark> gene encoding the <mark>dominant Cpn60α subunit</mark>, <mark>CPNA1</mark> (<mark>AtCpn60α1</mark>), mainly affected embryonic cotyledon development at the torpedo stage and thereafter.
Further studies demonstrated that <mark>CPNA2</mark> can form a functional <mark>chaperonin</mark> with <mark>CPNB2</mark> (<mark>AtCpn60β2</mark>) and <mark>CPNB3</mark> (<mark>AtCpn60β3</mark>), while the functional partners of <mark>CPNA1</mark> are <mark>CPNB1</mark> (<mark>AtCpn60β1</mark>) and <mark>CPNB2</mark>.
We also revealed that the functional <mark>chaperonin</mark> containing <mark>CPNA2</mark> could assist the folding of a specific substrate, <mark>KASI</mark> (<mark>β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I</mark>), and that the <mark>KASI</mark> protein level was remarkably reduced due to loss-of-function of <mark>CPNA2</mark>.
Furthermore, the reduction in the <mark>KASI</mark> protein level was shown to be the possible cause for the arrest of <mark>cpna2</mark> embryos.
Our findings indicate that the two <mark>Cpn60α<<mark>Cpn60α subunits</mark> in Arabidopsis play different roles during embryo development through forming distinct <mark>chaperonins</mark> with specific <mark>AtCpn60β</mark> to assist the folding of particular substrates, thus providing novel insights into functional divergence of <mark>Cpn60α<<mark>Cpn60α subunits</mark> in plants.
Targeted <mark>Pth4</mark>-expressing cell ablation impairs skeletal mineralization in zebrafish.
Skeletal development and mineralization are essential processes driven by the coordinated action of neural signals, circulating molecules and local factors.
Our previous studies revealed that the novel neuropeptide <mark>Pth4</mark>, synthesized by hypothalamic cells, was involved in bone metabolism via phosphate regulation in adult zebrafish.
Here, we investigate the role of <mark>pth4</mark> during skeletal development using single-cell resolution, two-photon laser ablation of <mark>Pth4</mark>:eGFP-expressing cells and confocal imaging in vivo.
Using a stable transgenic <mark>Pth4</mark>:eGFP zebrafish line, we identify <mark>Pth4</mark>:eGFP-expressing cells as post-mitotic neurons.
After targeted ablation of eGFP-expressing cells in the hypothalamus, the experimental larvae exhibited impaired mineralization of the craniofacial bones whereas cartilage development was normal.
In addition to a decrease in <mark>pth4</mark> transcript levels, we noted altered expression of <mark>phex</mark> and <mark>entpd5</mark>, genes associated with phosphate homeostasis and mineralization, as well as a delay in the expression of osteoblast differentiation markers such as <mark>sp7</mark> and <mark>sparc</mark>.
Taken together, these results suggest that <mark>Pth4</mark>-expressing hypothalamic neurons participate in the regulation of bone metabolism, possibly through regulating phosphate balance during zebrafish development.
<mark>Protein tyrosine phosphatase</mark> <mark>PTPN22</mark> is dispensable for dendritic cell antigen processing and promotion of T-cell activation by dendritic cells.
The <mark>PTPN22</mark>R620W single nucleotide polymorphism increases the risk of developing multiple autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.
<mark>PTPN22</mark> is highly expressed in antigen presenting cells (APCs) where the expression of the murine disease associated variant orthologue (<mark>Ptpn22</mark>R619W) is reported to dysregulate <mark>pattern recognition receptor</mark> signalling in dendritic cells (DCs) and promote T-cell proliferation.
Because T-cell activation is dependent on DC antigen uptake, degradation and presentation, we analysed the efficiency of these functions in splenic and <mark>GM-CSF</mark> bone marrow derived DC from wild type (WT), <mark>Ptpn22</mark>-/- or <mark>Ptpn22</mark>R619W mutant mice.
Results indicated no differential ability of DCs to uptake antigen via macropinocytosis or receptor-mediated endocytosis.
Antigen degradation and presentation was also equal as was WT T-cell conjugate formation and subsequent T-cell proliferation.
Despite the likely presence of multiple <mark>phosphatase</mark>-regulated pathways in the antigen uptake, processing and presentation pathways that we investigated, we observed that <mark>Ptpn22</mark> and the R619W autoimmune associated variant were dispensable.
These important findings indicate that under non-inflammatory conditions there is no requirement for <mark>Ptpn22</mark> in DC dependent antigen uptake and T-cell activation.
Our findings reveal that perturbations in antigen uptake and processing, a fundamental pathway determining adaptive immune responses, are unlikely to provide a mechanism for the risk associated with the <mark>Ptpn22</mark> autoimmune associated polymorphism.
An inducible mouse model of <mark>podocin</mark>-mutation-related nephrotic syndrome.
Mutations in the <mark>NPHS2</mark> gene, encoding <mark>podocin</mark>, cause hereditary nephrotic syndrome.
The most common <mark>podocin</mark> mutation, R138Q, is associated with early disease onset and rapid progression to end-stage renal disease.
Knock-in mice carrying a R140Q mutation, the mouse analogue of human R138Q, show developmental arrest of podocytes and lethal renal failure at neonatal age.
Here we created a conditional <mark>podocin</mark> knock-in model named <mark>NPHS2</mark> R140Q/-, using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase, which permits to study the effects of the mutation in postnatal life.
Within the first week of R140Q hemizygosity induction the animals developed proteinuria, which peaked after 4-5 weeks.
Subsequently the animals developed progressive renal failure, with a median survival time of 12 (95% CI: 11-13) weeks.
Foot process fusion was observed within one week, progressing to severe and global effacement in the course of the disease.
The number of podocytes per glomerulus gradually diminished to 18% compared to healthy controls 12-16 weeks after induction.
The fraction of segmentally sclerosed glomeruli was 25%, 85% and 97% at 2, 4 and 8 weeks, respectively.
Severe tubulointerstitial fibrosis was present at later disease stage and was correlated quantitatively with the level of proteinuria at early disease stages.
While R140Q <mark>podocin</mark> mRNA expression was elevated, protein abundance was reduced by more than 50% within one week following induction.
Whereas miRNA21 expression persistently increased during the first 4 weeks, miRNA-193a expression peaked 2 weeks after induction.
In conclusion, the inducible R140Q-<mark>podocin</mark> mouse model is an auspicious model of the most common genetic cause of human nephrotic syndrome, with a spontaneous disease course strongly reminiscent of the human disorder.
This model constitutes a valuable tool to test the efficacy of novel pharmacological interventions aimed to improve podocyte function and viability and attenuate proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and progressive renal failure.
Thiamine deficiency activates <mark>hypoxia inducible factor-1α</mark> to facilitate pro-apoptotic responses in mouse primary astrocytes.
Thiamine is an essential enzyme cofactor required for proper metabolic function and maintenance of metabolism and energy production in the brain.
In developed countries, thiamine deficiency (TD) is most often manifested following chronic alcohol consumption leading to impaired mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, inflammation and excitotoxicity.
These biochemical lesions result in apoptotic cell death in both neurons and astrocytes.
Comparable histological injuries in patients with hypoxia/ischemia and TD have been described in the thalamus and mammillary bodies, suggesting a congruency between the cellular responses to these stresses.
Consistent with hypoxia/ischemia, TD stabilizes and activates <mark>Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α</mark> (<mark>HIF-1α</mark>) under physiological oxygen levels.
However, the role of TD-induced <mark>HIF-1α</mark> in neurological injury is currently unknown.
Using Western blot analysis and RT-PCR, we have demonstrated that TD induces <mark>HIF-1α</mark> expression and activity in primary mouse astrocytes.
We observed a time-dependent increase in mRNA and protein expression of the pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory <mark>HIF-1α</mark> target genes <mark>MCP1</mark>, <mark>BNIP3</mark>, <mark>Nix</mark> and <mark>Noxa</mark> during TD.
We also observed apoptotic cell death in TD as demonstrated by PI/<mark>Annexin V</mark> staining, TUNEL assay, and Cell Death ELISA.
Pharmacological inhibition of <mark>HIF-1α</mark> activity using YC1 and thiamine repletion both reduced expression of pro-apoptotic <mark>HIF-1α</mark> target genes and apoptotic cell death in TD.
These results demonstrate that induction of <mark>HIF-1α</mark> mediated transcriptional up-regulation of pro-apoptotic/inflammatory signaling contributes to astrocyte cell death during thiamine deficiency.
Gene expression profiling of the <mark>Notch</mark>-<mark>AhR</mark>-<mark>IL22</mark> axis at homeostasis and in response to tissue injury.
<mark>Notch</mark> and <mark>Interleukin-22</mark> signaling are known to regulate tissue homeostasis and response to injury in humans and mice, and the induction of endogenous <mark>arylhydrocarbon receptor</mark> ligands through <mark>Notch</mark> links the two pathways in a hierarchical fashion.
However, in adults the species-, organ- and injury-specific gene expression of the <mark>Notch</mark>-<mark>AhR</mark>-<mark>IL22</mark> axis components is unknown.
We therefore performed gene expression profiling of <mark>DLL1</mark>, <mark>DLL3</mark>, <mark>DLL4</mark>, <mark>DLK1</mark>, <mark>DLK2</mark>, <mark>JAG1</mark>, <mark>JAG2</mark>, <mark>Notch1</mark>, <mark>Notch2</mark>, <mark>Notch3</mark>, <mark>Notch4</mark>, <mark>ADAM17</mark>/<mark>TACE</mark>, <mark>PSEN1</mark>, <mark>BSG</mark>/<mark>CD147</mark>, <mark>RBP-J</mark>, <mark>HES1</mark>, <mark>HES5</mark>, <mark>HEY1</mark>, <mark>HEYL</mark>, <mark>AHR</mark>, <mark>ARNT</mark>, <mark>ARNT2</mark>, <mark>CYP1A1</mark>, <mark>CYP24A1</mark>, <mark>IL22</mark>, <mark>IL22RA1</mark>, <mark>IL22RA2</mark>, <mark>IL10RB</mark>, and <mark>STAT3</mark> under homeostatic conditions in 10 mature murine and human organs.
Additionally, the expression of these genes was assessed in murine models of acute sterile inflammation and progressive fibrosis.
We show that there are organ specific gene expression profiles of the <mark>Notch</mark>-<mark>AhR</mark>-<mark>IL22</mark> axis in humans and mice.
Although there is an overall interspecies congruency, specific differences between human and murine expression signatures do exist.
In murine tissues with <mark>AHR</mark>/<mark>ARNT</mark> expression <mark>CYP1A1</mark> and <mark>IL22</mark> were correlated with <mark>HES5</mark> and <mark>HEYL</mark> expression, while in human tissues no such correlation was found.
<mark>Notch</mark>- and <mark>AhR</mark>-signaling are involved in renal inflammation and fibrosis with specific gene expression changes in each model.
Despite the presence of all <mark>Notch</mark> pathway molecules in the kidney and a model-specific induction of <mark>Notch</mark> ligands, <mark>IL22</mark> was only upregulated in acute inflammation, but rapidly downregulated during regeneration.
This implies that for targeting injury responses e.g. via <mark>Interleukin-22</mark>, species-specific differences, injury-type and timepoints have to be considered.
<mark>Netrin-1</mark> is a novel regulator of vascular endothelial function in diabetes.
BACKGROUND: <mark>Netrin-1</mark>, a secreted laminin-like protein identified as an axon guidance molecule, has been shown to be of critical importance in the cardiovascular system.
Recent studies have revealed pro-angiogenic, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties of <mark>netrin-1</mark> as well as cardioprotective actions against myocardial injury in diabetic mice.
AIM: To examine the role of <mark>netrin-1</mark> in diabetes-and high glucose (HG)-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED) using <mark>netrin-1</mark> transgenic mice (Tg3) and cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC).
MAIN OUTCOME: Overexpression of <mark>netrin-1</mark> prevented diabetes-induced VED in aorta from diabetic mice and netrin-1 treatment attenuated HG-induced impairment of <mark>nitric oxide synthase</mark> (<mark>NOS</mark>) function in BAECs.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Experiments were performed in Tg3 and littermate control (WT) mice rendered diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ) and in BAECs treated with HG (25 mmol/L).
Levels of <mark>netrin-1</mark> and its receptor <mark>DCC</mark>, markers of inflammation and apoptosis and vascular function were assessed in aortas from diabetic and non-diabetic Tg3 and WT mice.
Vascular <mark>netrin-1</mark> in WT mice was reduced under diabetic conditions.
Aortas from non-diabetic Tg3 and WT mice showed similar maximum endothelium-dependent relaxation (MEDR) (83% and 87%, respectively).
MEDR was markedly impaired in aorta from diabetic WT mice (51%).
This effect was significantly blunted in Tg3 diabetic aortas (70%).
Improved vascular relaxation in Tg3 diabetic mice was associated with increased levels of <mark>phospho-ERK1/2</mark> and reduced levels of oxidant stress, <mark>NFκB</mark>, <mark>COX-2</mark>, <mark>p16INK4A</mark>, cleaved <mark>caspase-3</mark> and <mark>p16</mark> and <mark>p53</mark> mRNA.
<mark>Netrin-1</mark> treatment prevented the HG-induced decrease in NO production and elevation of oxidative stress and apoptosis in BAECs.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes decreases aortic levels of <mark>netrin-1</mark>.
However, overexpression of <mark>netrin-1</mark> attenuates diabetes-induced VED and limits the reduction of NO levels, while increasing expression of <mark>p-ERK1/2</mark>, and suppressing oxidative stress and inflammatory and apoptotic processes.
Enhancement of <mark>netrin-1</mark> function may be a useful therapeutic means for preventing vascular dysfunction in diabetes.
<mark>Zinc-finger protein 418</mark> overexpression protects against cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.
BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigated the effect and mechanism of <mark>zinc-finger protein 418</mark> (<mark>ZNF418</mark>) on cardiac hypertrophy caused by aortic banding (AB), phenylephrine (PE) or angiotensin II (Ang II) in vivo and in vitro.
METHODS: The expression of <mark>ZNF418</mark> in hearts of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and AB-induced cardiac hypertrophy mice, as well as in Ang II- or PE-induced hypertrophic primary cardiomyocytes was detected by western blotting.
Then, the expression of <mark>ZNF418</mark> was up-regulated or down-regulated in AB-induced cardiac hypertrophy mice and Ang II -induced hypertrophic primary cardiomyocytes.
The hypertrophic responses and fibrosis were evaluated by echocardiography and histological analysis.
The mRNA levels of hypertrophy markers and fibrotic markers were detected by RT-qPCR.
Furthermore, the phosphorylation and total levels of <mark>c-Jun</mark> were measured by western blotting.
RESULTS: <mark>ZNF418</mark> was markedly down-regulated in hearts of cardiac hypertrophy and hypertrophic primary cardiomyocytes.
Down-regulated <mark>ZNF418</mark> exacerbated the myocyte size and fibrosis, moreover increased the mRNA levels of <mark>ANP</mark>, <mark>BNP</mark>, <mark>b-MHC</mark>, <mark>MCIP1.4</mark>, <mark>collagen 1a</mark>, <mark>collagen III</mark>, <mark>MMP-2</mark> and <mark>fibronection</mark> in hearts of AB-treated <mark>ZNF418</mark> knockout mice or Ang II-treated cardiomyocytes with AdshZNF418.
Conversely, these hypertrophic responses were reduced in the <mark>ZNF418</mark> transgenic (TG) mice treated by AB and the Ad<mark>ZNF418</mark>-transfected primary cardiomyocytes treated by Ang II.
Additionally, the deficiency of <mark>ZNF418</mark> enhanced the phosphorylation level of <mark>c-jun</mark>, and overexpression of <mark>ZNF418</mark> suppressed the phosphorylation level of <mark>c-jun</mark> in vivo and in vitro.
CONCLUSION: <mark>ZNF418</mark> maybe attenuate hypertrophic responses by inhibiting the activity of <mark>c-jun</mark>/<mark>AP-1</mark>.
Lipopolysaccharide potentiates platelet responses via <mark>toll-like receptor 4</mark>-stimulated <mark>Akt</mark>-<mark>Erk</mark>-<mark>PLA2</mark> signalling.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is a principal cause of the symptoms of sepsis.
LPS has been reported to modulate the function of platelets although the underlying mechanisms of LPS action in these cells remain unclear.
Platelets express the <mark>Toll-like receptor 4</mark> (<mark>TLR4</mark>) which serves as a receptor for LPS, although the potential role of <mark>TLR4</mark> and associated cell signalling in controlling platelet responses to LPS has not been extensively explored.
In this study, we therefore investigated the actions of LPS prepared from different strains of Escherichia coli on platelet function, the underlying signalling mechanisms, and the potential role of <mark>TLR4</mark> in orchestrating these.
We report that LPS increased the aggregation of washed platelets stimulated by thromboxane (U46619) or <mark>GPVI collagen receptor</mark> agonists, effects that were prevented by a <mark>TLR4</mark> antagonist.
Associated with this, LPS enhanced <mark>fibrinogen</mark> binding, <mark>P-selectin</mark> exposure and reactive oxygen species (ROS) release.
Increase of ROS was found to be important for the actions of LPS on platelets, since these were inhibited in the presence of <mark>superoxide dismutase</mark> or <mark>catalase</mark>.
The effects of LPS were associated with phosphorylation of <mark>Akt</mark>, <mark>ERK1/2</mark> and <mark>PLA2</mark> in stimulated platelets, and inhibitors of <mark>PI3-kinase</mark>, <mark>Akt</mark> and <mark>ERK1/2</mark> reduced significantly LPS enhanced platelet function and associated ROS production.
Furthermore, inhibition of platelet <mark>cyclooxygenase</mark> or the <mark>thromboxane receptor</mark>, revealed an important role for thromboxane A2.
We therefore conclude that LPS increases human platelet activation through a <mark>TLR4</mark>-<mark>PI3K</mark>-<mark>Akt</mark>-<mark>ERK1/2</mark>-<mark>PLA2</mark> -dependent pathway that is dependent on ROS and TXA2 formation.
No evidence for association between <mark>APOL1</mark> kidney disease risk alleles and Human African Trypanosomiasis in two Ugandan populations.
BACKGROUND: Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) manifests as an acute form caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (Tbr) and a chronic form caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (Tbg).
Previous studies have suggested a host genetic role in infection outcomes, particularly for <mark>APOL1</mark>.
We have undertaken candidate gene association studies (CGAS) in a Ugandan Tbr and a Tbg HAT endemic area, to determine whether polymorphisms in <mark>IL10</mark>, <mark>IL8</mark>, <mark>IL4</mark>, <mark>HLAG</mark>, <mark>TNFA</mark>, <mark>TNX4LB</mark>, <mark>IL6</mark>, <mark>IFNG</mark>, <mark>MIF</mark>, <mark>APOL1</mark>, <mark>HLAA</mark>, <mark>IL1B</mark>, <mark>IL4R</mark>, <mark>IL12B</mark>, <mark>IL12R</mark>, <mark>HP</mark>, <mark>HPR</mark>, and <mark>CFH</mark> have a role in HAT.
METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: We included 238 and 202 participants from the Busoga Tbr and Northwest Uganda Tbg endemic areas respectively.
Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) genotype data were analysed in the CGAS.
The study was powered to find odds ratios &gt; 2 but association testing of the SNPs with HAT yielded no positive associations i.e. none significant after correction for multiple testing.
However there was strong evidence for no association with Tbr HAT and <mark>APOL1</mark> G2 of the size previously reported in the Kabermaido district of Uganda. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A recent study in the Soroti and Kaberamaido focus in Central Uganda found that the <mark>APOL1</mark> G2 allele was strongly associated with protection against Tbr HAT (odds ratio = 0.2, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.48, p = 0.0001).
However, in our study no effect of G2 on Tbr HAT was found, despite being well powered to find a similar sized effect (OR = 0.9281, 95% CI: 0.482 to 1.788, p = 0.8035).
It is possible that the G2 allele is protective from Tbr in the Soroti/Kabermaido focus but not in the Iganga district of Busoga, which differ in ethnicity and infection history.
Mechanisms underlying HAT infection outcome and virulence are complex and might differ between populations, and likely involve several host, parasite or even environmental factors.
Regulation of <mark>TLR4</mark> expression mediates the attenuating effect of <mark>erythropoietin</mark> on inflammation and myocardial fibrosis in rat heart.
The mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory or antifibrotic activity of <mark>erythropoietin</mark> (<mark>EPO</mark>) in myocardial fibrosis (MF) remains elusive.
In the current study, abdominal aortic constriction (AAC) was performed on rats and <mark>EPO</mark> and/or <mark>Toll-like receptor (TLR)4</mark> were overexpressed in rat hearts through intramyocardial administration of lentivirus expressing the <mark>EPO</mark> and <mark>TLR4</mark> genes.
Hematoxylin and eosin staining and Masson's trichrome staining were performed on tissue sections from rat hearts for histopathological examination.
ELISA was used to determine the levels of inflammatory mediators in serum.
Gene expression levels were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and protein expression levels were determined by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining.
The results indicated that <mark>EPO</mark> overexpression improved MF in rat hearts, by inhibiting the release of <mark>transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1</mark>, <mark>tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha</mark>, <mark>interleukin (IL)-6</mark>, <mark>IL-1beta</mark>, <mark>IL-17A</mark>, <mark>matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9</mark> and <mark>MMP-2</mark>.
Moreover, <mark>EPO</mark> overexpression suppressed the expression of <mark>TLR4</mark>, while promoting <mark>phosphoinositide 3-kinase</mark> (<mark>PI3K</mark>) and phosphorylated <mark>AKT serine/threonine kinase 1</mark> (<mark>Akt</mark>) expression levels.
However, the beneficial effects of <mark>EPO</mark> were attenuated by overexpression of <mark>TLR4</mark>.
In addition, inhibition of <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> signaling activity by treatment with LY294002 markedly reversed the protective effect of <mark>EPO</mark> on the AAC-induced MF.
Taken together, the present study demonstrated that <mark>EPO</mark> may have a critical role against MF by activating <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark> signaling and by downregulating <mark>TLR4</mark> expression, thereby inhibiting the release of <mark>TGF-beta1</mark>, <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>IL-1beta</mark>, <mark>IL-17A</mark>, <mark>MMP-9</mark> and <mark>MMP-2</mark>.
These findings suggest that the <mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>Akt</mark>/<mark>TLR4</mark> signaling pathway is associated with the anti-inflammatory effects of <mark>EPO</mark> and may play a role in attenuating AAC-induced MF.
Downregulation of splicing regulator <mark>RBFOX1</mark> compromises visual depth perception.
<mark>Rbfox1</mark> is a splicing regulator that has been associated with various neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, mental retardation, epilepsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia.
We show that in adult rodent retinas, <mark>Rbfox1</mark> is expressed in all types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and in certain subsets of amacrine cells (ACs), within the inner nuclear (INL) and ganglion cell (GCL) layers.
In the INL, all <mark>Rbfox1</mark>-positive cells were colocalized with GABAergic ACs, however not all GABAergic ACs were immunostained for <mark>Rbfox1</mark>.
In the GCL, a vast majority of GABAergic dACs were <mark>Rbfox1</mark>-immunopositive.
Furthermore, all cholinergic starburst ACs (SACs) in the INL (type a) and in the GCL (type b) were <mark>Rbfox1</mark> positive.
The expression of <mark>Rbfox1</mark> in the retina significantly overlapped with expression of <mark>Rbfox2</mark>, another member of Rbfox family of proteins.
<mark>Rbfox2</mark>, in addition to RGCs and ACs, was also expressed in horizontal cells.
In developing retinas at E12 and E15, <mark>Rbfox1</mark> is localized to the cytoplasm of differentiating RGCs and ACs.
Between P0 and P5, <mark>Rbfox1</mark> subcellular localization switched from cytoplasmic to predominantly nuclear.
Downregulation of <mark>Rbfox1</mark> in adult <mark>Rbfox1</mark>loxP/loxP mice had no detectable effect on retinal gross morphology.
However, the visual cliff test revealed marked abnormalities of depth perception of these animals.
RNA sequencing of retinal transcriptomes of control and <mark>Rbfox1</mark> knockout animals identified a number of <mark>Rbfox1</mark>-regulated genes that are involved in establishing neuronal circuits and synaptic transmission, including <mark>Vamp1</mark>, <mark>Vamp2</mark>, <mark>Snap25</mark>, <mark>Trak2</mark>, and <mark>Slc1A7</mark>, suggesting the role of <mark>Rbfox1</mark> in facilitating synaptic communications between ACs and RGCs.
<mark>Nonmuscle myosin II</mark> isoforms interact with <mark>sodium channel alpha subunits</mark>.
<mark>Sodium channels</mark> play pivotal roles in health and diseases due to their ability to control cellular excitability.
The pore-forming <mark>alpha-subunits (sodium <mark>sodium channel alpha subunits</mark>e voltage-sensitive channels</mark> (i.e., <mark>Nav1.1-1.9</mark>) and the <mark>nonvolt<mark>nonvoltage-dependent channe</mark>> (i.e., <mark>Nax</mark>) share a common structural motif and selectivity for sodium ions.
We hypothesized that the <mark>actin</mark>-based <mark>nonmuscle myosin II</mark> motor proteins, <mark>nonmuscle myosin heavy chain-IIA</mark>/<mark>myh9</mark>, and <mark>nonmuscle myosin heavy chain-IIB</mark>/<mark>myh10</mark> might interact with <mark>sodium channel alpha subunits</mark> to play an important role in their transport, trafficking, and/or function.
Immunochemical and electrophysiological assays were conducted using rodent nervous (brain and dorsal root ganglia) tissues and ND7/23 cells coexpressing <mark>Nav subunits</mark> and recombinant <mark>myosins</mark>.
Immunoprecipitation of <mark>myh9</mark> and <mark>myh10</mark> from rodent brain tissues led to the coimmunoprecipitation of <mark>Nax</mark>, <mark>Nav1.2</mark>, and <mark>Nav1.3</mark> subunits, but not <mark>Nav1.1</mark> and <mark>Nav1.6</mark> subunits, expressed there.
Similarly, immunoprecipitation of <mark>myh9</mark> and <mark>myh10</mark> from rodent dorsal root ganglia tissues led to the coimmunoprecipitation of <mark>Nav1.7</mark> and <mark>Nav1.8</mark> subunits, but not <mark>Nav1.9</mark> subunits, expressed there.
The functional implication of one of these interactions was assessed by coexpressing <mark>myh10</mark> along with <mark>Nav1.8</mark> subunits in ND7/23 cells.
<mark>Myh10</mark> overexpression led to three-fold increase ( P &lt; 0.01) in the current density of <mark>Nav1.8 channels</mark> expressed in ND7/23 cells.
<mark>Myh10</mark> coexpression also hyperpolarized voltage-dependent activation and steady-state fast inactivation of <mark>Nav1.8 channels</mark>.
In addition, coexpression of <mark>myh10</mark> reduced ( P &lt; 0.01) the offset of fast inactivation and the amplitude of the ramp currents of <mark>Nav1.8 channels</mark>.
These results indicate that nonmuscle myosin heavy chain-IIs interact with sodium channel alpha subunits subunits in an isoform-dependent manner and influence their functional properties.
Cooperative Enhancer Activation by <mark>TLX1</mark> and <mark>STAT5</mark> Drives Development of <mark>NUP214</mark>-<mark>ABL1</mark>/<mark>TLX1</mark>-Positive T Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.
The <mark>NUP214</mark>-<mark>ABL1</mark> fusion is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that is significantly associated with overexpression of the <mark>TLX1</mark> and <mark>TLX3</mark> transcription factors in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).
Here we show that <mark>NUP214</mark>-<mark>ABL1</mark> cooperates with <mark>TLX1</mark> in driving T-ALL development using a transgenic mouse model and human T-ALL cells.
Using integrated ChIP-sequencing, ATAC-sequencing, and RNA-sequencing data, we demonstrate that <mark>TLX1</mark> and <mark>STAT5</mark>, the downstream effector of <mark>NUP214</mark>-<mark>ABL1</mark>, co-bind poised enhancer regions, and cooperatively activate the expression of key proto-oncogenes such as <mark>MYC</mark> and <mark>BCL2</mark>.
Inhibition of <mark>STAT5</mark>, downregulation of <mark>TLX1</mark> or <mark>MYC</mark>, or interference with enhancer function through <mark>BET</mark>-inhibitor treatment leads to reduction of target gene expression and induction of leukemia cell death.
Activation of <mark>Nrf2</mark> in the liver is associated with stress resistance mediated by suppression of the <mark>growth hormone</mark>-regulated <mark>STAT5b</mark> transcription factor.
The transcription factor <mark>Nrf2</mark> (encoded by <mark>Nfe2l2</mark>) induces expression of numerous detoxifying and antioxidant genes in response to oxidative stress.
The cytoplasmic protein <mark>Keap1</mark> interacts with and represses <mark>Nrf2</mark> function.
Computational approaches were developed to identify factors that modulate <mark>Nrf2</mark> in a mouse liver gene expression compendium.
Forty-eight <mark>Nrf2</mark> biomarker genes were identified using profiles from the livers of mice in which <mark>Nrf2</mark> was activated genetically in <mark>Keap1</mark>-null mice or chemically by a potent activator of <mark>Nrf2</mark> signaling.
The rank-based Running Fisher statistical test was used to determine the correlation between the <mark>Nrf2</mark> biomarker genes and a test set of 81 profiles with known <mark>Nrf2</mark> activation status demonstrating a balanced accuracy of 96%.
For a large number of factors examined in the compendium, we found consistent relationships between activation of <mark>Nrf2</mark> and feminization of the liver transcriptome through suppression of the male-specific <mark>growth hormone</mark> (<mark>GH</mark>)-regulated transcription factor <mark>STAT5b</mark>.
The livers of female mice exhibited higher <mark>Nrf2</mark> activation than male mice in untreated or chemical-treated conditions.
In male mice, <mark>Nrf2</mark> was activated by treatment with ethinyl estradiol, whereas in female mice, <mark>Nrf2</mark> was suppressed by treatment with testosterone.
<mark>Nrf2</mark> was activated in 5 models of disrupted <mark>GH</mark> signaling containing mutations in <mark>Pit1</mark>, <mark>Prop1</mark>, <mark>Ghrh</mark>, <mark>Ghrhr</mark>, and <mark>Ghr</mark>.
Out of 59 chemical treatments that activated <mark>Nrf2</mark>, 36 exhibited <mark>STAT5b</mark> suppression in the male liver.
The <mark>Nrf2</mark>-<mark>STAT5b</mark> coupling was absent in in vitro comparisons of chemical treatments.
Treatment of male and female mice with 11 chemicals that induce oxidative stress led to activation of <mark>Nrf2</mark> to greater extents in females than males.
The enhanced basal and inducible levels of <mark>Nrf2</mark> activation in females relative to males provides a molecular explanation for the greater resistance often seen in females vs. males to age-dependent diseases and chemical-induced toxicity.
<mark>Cyp1b1</mark> expression impacts the angiogenic and inflammatory properties of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells.
<mark>Cytochrome P450 1B1</mark> (<mark>CYP1B1</mark>) is a member of the <mark>cytochrome p450</mark> family of enzymes that catalyze <mark>mono-oxygenase</mark> reactions.
Although constitutive <mark>Cyp1b1</mark> expression is limited in hepatocytes, its expression and function in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) remains unknown.
Here we determined the impact of <mark>Cyp1b1</mark> expression on LSEC properties prepared from <mark>Cyp1b1</mark>+/+ and <mark>Cyp1b1</mark>-/- mice.
LSEC expressed <mark>PECAM-1</mark>, <mark>VE-cadherin</mark>, and <mark>B4 lectin</mark> similar to EC from other mouse tissues.
<mark>Cyp1b1</mark> +/+ LSEC constitutively expressed significant levels of <mark>Cyp1b1</mark>, while <mark>Cyp1b1</mark>-/- LSEC lacked <mark>Cyp1b1</mark> expression.
LSEC also expressed <mark>VEGFR3</mark>, <mark>PROX-1</mark>, and <mark>LYVE-1</mark>, <mark>VEGFR1</mark> and <mark>VEGFR2</mark>, as well as other cell adhesion molecules including <mark>ICAM-1</mark>, <mark>ICAM-2</mark>, <mark>VCAM-1</mark>, and <mark>thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) receptors</mark>, <mark>CD36</mark> and <mark>CD47</mark>.
However, the expression of <mark>PV-1</mark> and <mark>stabilin</mark> (fenestration markers), and <mark>endoglin</mark> were limited in these cells.
The <mark>Cyp1b1</mark>-/- LSEC showed limited fenestration, and decreased levels of <mark>VEGF</mark> and <mark>BMP6</mark>.
<mark>Cyp1b1</mark>-/- LSEC also showed a decrease in the levels of <mark>VE-cadherin</mark> and <mark>ZO-1</mark> impacting adherens and gap junction formation.
<mark>Cyp1b1</mark>-/- LSEC were significantly more apoptotic, proliferated at a faster rate, and were less adherent and more migratory.
These changes were attributed, in part, to decreased amounts of <mark>TSP1</mark> and increased <mark>AKT</mark> and <mark>ERK</mark> activation.
The expressions of <mark>integrins</mark> were also altered by the lack of <mark>Cyp1b1</mark>, but the ability of these cells to undergo capillary morphogenesis was minimally affected.
Furthermore, <mark>Cyp1b1</mark>-/- LSEC expressed lower levels of inflammatory mediators <mark>MCP-1</mark> and <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>.
Thus, <mark>Cyp1b1</mark> expression has a significant impact on LSEC angiogenic and inflammatory functions.
Ca2+-dependent endoplasmic reticulum stress correlation with astrogliosis involves upregulation of <mark>KCa3.1</mark> and inhibition of <mark>AKT</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark> signaling.
BACKGROUND: The <mark>intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel</mark> <mark>KCa3.1</mark> was recently shown to control the phenotype switch of reactive astrogliosis (RA) in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: <mark>KCa3.1</mark> channels expression and cell localization in the brains of AD patients and <mark>APP</mark>/<mark>PS1</mark> mice model were measured by immunoblotting and immunostaining.
<mark>APP</mark>/<mark>PS1</mark> mice and <mark>KCa3.1</mark>-/-/<mark>APP</mark>/<mark>PS1</mark> mice were subjected to Morris water maze test to evaluate the spatial memory deficits.
Glia activation and neuron loss was measured by immunostaining.
Fluo-4AM was used to measure cytosolic Ca2+ level in beta-amyloid (Abeta) induced reactive astrocytes in vitro.
RESULTS: <mark>KCa3.1</mark> expression was markedly associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) in both Abeta-stimulated primary astrocytes and brain lysates of AD patients and <mark>APP</mark>/<mark>PS1</mark> AD mice.
The <mark>KCa3.1</mark> channel was shown to regulate store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) through an interaction with the <mark>Ca2+ channel</mark> <mark>Orai1</mark> in primary astrocytes.
Gene deletion or pharmacological blockade of <mark>KCa3.1</mark> protected against SOCE-induced Ca2+ overload and ER stress via the <mark>protein kinase B</mark> (<mark>AKT</mark>) signaling pathway in astrocytes.
Importantly, gene deletion or blockade of <mark>KCa3.1</mark> restored <mark>AKT</mark>/<mark>mechanistic target of rapamycin</mark> signaling both in vivo and in vitro.
Consistent with these in vitro data, expression levels of the ER stress markers <mark>78-kDa glucose-regulated protein</mark> and <mark>CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein</mark>, as well as that of the RA marker <mark>glial fibrillary acidic protein</mark> were increased in <mark>APP</mark>/<mark>PS1</mark> AD mouse model.
Elimination of <mark>KCa3.1</mark> in <mark>KCa3.1</mark>-/-/<mark>APP</mark>/<mark>PS1</mark> mice corrected these abnormal responses.
Moreover, glial activation and neuroinflammation were attenuated in the hippocampi of <mark>KCa3.1</mark>-/-/<mark>APP</mark>/<mark>PS1</mark> mice, as compared with <mark>APP</mark>/<mark>PS1</mark> mice.
In addition, memory deficits and neuronal loss in <mark>APP</mark>/<mark>PS1</mark> mice were reversed in <mark>KCa3.1</mark>-/-/<mark>APP</mark>/<mark>PS1</mark> mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that <mark>KCa3.1</mark> is involved in the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis in astrocytes and attenuation of the UPR and ER stress, thus contributing to memory deficits and neuronal loss.
The Yeast DNA Damage Checkpoint Kinase <mark>Rad53</mark> Targets the Exoribonuclease, <mark>Xrn1</mark>.
The highly conserved DNA damage response (DDR) pathway monitors the genomic integrity of the cell and protects against genotoxic stresses.
The <mark>apical kinases</mark>, <mark>Mec1</mark> and <mark>Tel1</mark> (<mark>ATR</mark> and <mark>ATM</mark> in human, respectively), initiate the DNA damage signaling cascade through the <mark>effector kinases</mark>, <mark>Rad53</mark> and <mark>Chk1</mark>, to regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair, chromatin remodeling, and transcription.
The DDR also regulates other cellular pathways, but direct substrates and mechanisms are still lacking.
Using a mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified novel targets of <mark>Rad53</mark>, many of which are proteins that are involved in RNA metabolism.
Of the 33 novel substrates identified, we verified that 12 are directly phosphorylated by <mark>Rad53</mark> in vitro: <mark>Xrn1</mark>, <mark>Gcd11</mark>, <mark>Rps7b</mark>, <mark>Ded1</mark>, <mark>Cho2</mark>, <mark>Pus1</mark>, <mark>Hst1</mark>, <mark>Srv2</mark>, <mark>Set3</mark>, <mark>Snu23</mark>, <mark>Alb1</mark>, and <mark>Scp160</mark>.
We further characterized <mark>Xrn1</mark>, a highly conserved <mark>5' exoribonuclease</mark> that functions in RNA degradation and the most enriched in our phosphoproteomics screen.
Phosphorylation of <mark>Xrn1</mark> by <mark>Rad53</mark> does not appear to affect <mark>Xrn1</mark>'s intrinsic nuclease activity in vitro, but may affect its activity or specificity in vivo.
<mark>MicroRNA-451a</mark> overexpression induces accelerated neuronal differentiation of Ntera2/D1 cells and ablation affects neurogenesis in <mark>microRNA-451a</mark>-/- mice.
<mark>MiR-451a</mark> is best known for its role in erythropoiesis and for its tumour suppressor features.
Here we show a role for <mark>miR-451a</mark> in neuronal differentiation through analysis of endogenous and ectopically expressed or silenced <mark>miR-451a</mark> in Ntera2/D1 cells during neuronal differentiation.
Furthermore, we compared neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus of <mark>miR-451a</mark>-/- and wild type mice.
<mark>MiR-451a</mark> overexpression in lentiviral transduced Ntera2/D1 cells was associated with a significant shifting of mRNA expression of the developmental markers <mark>Nestin</mark>, <mark>betaIII Tubulin</mark>, <mark>NF200</mark>, <mark>DCX</mark> and <mark>MAP2</mark> to earlier developmental time points, compared to control vector transduced cells.
In line with this, accelerated neuronal network formation in AB.G.<mark>miR-451a</mark> transduced cells, as well as an increase in neurite outgrowth both in number and length was observed.
<mark>MiR-451a</mark> targets genes <mark>MIF</mark>, <mark>AKT1</mark>, <mark>CAB39</mark>, <mark>YWHAZ</mark>, <mark>RAB14</mark>, <mark>TSC1</mark>, <mark>OSR1</mark>, <mark>POU3F2</mark>, <mark>TNS4</mark>, <mark>PSMB8</mark>, <mark>CXCL16</mark>, <mark>CDKN2D</mark> and <mark>IL6R</mark> were, moreover, either constantly downregulated or exhibited shifted expression profiles in AB.G.<mark>miR-451a</mark> transduced cells.
Lentiviral knockdown of endogenous <mark>miR-451a</mark> expression in Ntera2/D1 cells resulted in decelerated differentiation.
Endogenous <mark>miR-451a</mark> expression was upregulated during development in the hippocampus of wildtype mice.
In situ hybridization revealed intensively stained single cells in the subgranular zone and the hilus of the dentate gyrus of wild type mice, while genetic ablation of <mark>miR-451a</mark> was observed to promote an imbalance between proliferation and neuronal differentiation in neurogenic brain regions, suggested by <mark>Ki67</mark> and <mark>DCX</mark> staining.
Taken together, these results provide strong support for a role of <mark>miR-451a</mark> in neuronal maturation processes in vitro and in vivo.
Conditional Inactivation of <mark>Nf1</mark> and <mark>Pten</mark> in Schwann Cells Results in Abnormal Neuromuscular Junction Maturation.
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) consists of three components, namely presynaptic motor neurons, postsynaptic muscle fibers and perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs).
The role of Schwann cells (SCs) in regulating NMJ structural and functional development remains unclear.
In this study, mice with conditional inactivation of <mark>neurofibromin 1</mark> (<mark>Nf1</mark>) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (<mark>Pten</mark>), specifically in SCs, resulted in delayed NMJ maturation that led to delayed muscle growth, recapitulating the muscular dystrophy condition observed in human neurofibromatosis type I syndrome (NF1) patients.
Expression levels of NMJ development related molecules such as <mark>cholinergic receptor, nicotinic, alpha polypeptide 1</mark> (<mark>Chrna1</mark>), <mark>agrin</mark> (<mark>Agrn</mark>), <mark>dystrophin, muscular dystrophy</mark> (<mark>Dmd</mark>), <mark>laminin, beta 2</mark> (<mark>Lamb2</mark>) and <mark>dystroglycan 1</mark> (<mark>Dag1</mark>) were also downregulated.
To further explore the molecular alterations in these SCs, <mark>NF1</mark>- and <mark>PTEN</mark>-related pathways were analyzed in mutant sciatic nerves.
As expected, hyperactive <mark>RAS</mark>/<mark>PI3K</mark>/<mark>AKT</mark>/<mark>mTOR</mark> signaling pathways were identified, suggesting the importance of these pathways for NMJ development, and subsequent muscle maturation.
Galangin Inhibits <mark>Thrombin</mark>-Induced <mark>MMP-9</mark> Expression in SK-N-SH Cells via <mark>Protein Kinase</mark>-Dependent <mark>NF-kappaB</mark> Phosphorylation.
Galangin, a member of the flavonol compounds of the flavonoids, could exert anti-inflammatory effects in various cell types.
It has been used for the treatment of arthritis, airway inflammation, stroke, and cognitive impairment.
<mark>Thrombin</mark>, one of the regulators of <mark>matrix metalloproteinase</mark> (<mark>MMPs</mark>), has been known as a vital factor of physiological and pathological processes, including cell migration, the blood-brain barrier breakdown, brain edema formation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death.
<mark>MMP-9</mark> especially may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases.
However, the effect of galangin in combating <mark>thrombin</mark>-induced <mark>MMP-9</mark> expression is not well understood in neurons.
Therefore, we attempted to explore the molecular mechanisms by which galangin inhibited <mark>MMP-9</mark> expression and cell migration induced by <mark>thrombin</mark> in SK-N-SH cells (a human neuroblastoma cell line).
Gelatin zymography, western blot, real-time PCR, and cell migration assay were used to elucidate the inhibitory effects of galangin on the <mark>thrmbin</mark>-mediated responses.
The results showed that galangin markedly attenuated the <mark>thrombin</mark>-stimulated phosphorylation of <mark>proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase</mark> (<mark>c-Src</mark>), <mark>proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2</mark> (<mark>Pyk2</mark>), <mark>protein kinase C (PKC)alpha/beta/delta</mark>, <mark>protein kinase B</mark> (<mark>Akt</mark>), <mark>mammalian target of rapamycin</mark> (<mark>mTOR</mark>), <mark>p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase</mark> (<mark>MAPK</mark>), <mark>Jun amino-terminal kinases</mark> (<mark>JNK)1/2</mark>, <mark>p38 MAPK</mark>, <mark>forkhead box protein O1</mark> (<mark>FoxO1</mark>), <mark>p65</mark>, and <mark>c-Jun</mark> and suppressed <mark>MMP-9</mark> expression and cell migration in SK-N-SH cells.
Our results concluded that galangin blocked the <mark>thrombin</mark>-induced <mark>MMP-9</mark> expression in SK-N-SH cells via inhibiting <mark>c-Src</mark>, <mark>Pyk2</mark>, <mark>PKCalpha/betaII/delta</mark>, <mark>Akt</mark>, <mark>mTOR</mark>, <mark>p42/p44 MAPK</mark>, <mark>JNK1/2</mark>, <mark>p38 MAPK</mark>, <mark>FoxO1</mark>, <mark>c-Jun</mark>, and <mark>p65</mark> phosphorylation and ultimately attenuated cell migration.
Therefore, galangin may be a potential candidate for the management of brain inflammatory diseases.
Model based on GA and DNN for prediction of mRNA-<mark>Smad7</mark> expression regulated by miRNAs in breast cancer.
BACKGROUND: The <mark>Smad7</mark> protein is negative regulator of the <mark>TGF-beta</mark> signaling pathway, which is upregulated in patients with breast cancer.
miRNAs regulate proteins expressions by arresting or degrading the mRNAs.
The purpose of this work is to identify a miRNAs profile that regulates the expression of the mRNA coding for <mark>Smad7</mark> in breast cancer using the data from patients with breast cancer obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas Project. METHODS: We develop an automatic search method based on genetic algorithms to find a predictive model based on deep neural networks (DNN) which fit the set of biological data and apply the Olden algorithm to identify the relative importance of each miRNAs.
RESULTS: A computational model of non-linear regression is shown, based on deep neural networks that predict the regulation given by the miRNA target transcripts mRNA coding for <mark>Smad7</mark> protein in patients with breast cancer, with R2 of 0.99 is shown and MSE of 0.00001.
In addition, the model is validated with the results in vivo and in vitro experiments reported in the literature.
The set of miRNAs <mark>hsa-mir-146a</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-93</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-375</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-205</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-15a</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-21</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-20a</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-503</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-29c</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-497</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-107</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-125a</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-200c</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-212</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-429</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-34a</mark>, <mark>hsa-let-7c</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-92b</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-33a</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-15b</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-224</mark>, <mark>hsa-mir-185</mark> and <mark>hsa-mir-10b</mark> integrate a profile that critically regulates the expression of the mRNA coding for <mark>Smad7</mark> in breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a genetic algorithm to select best features as DNN inputs (miRNAs).
The genetic algorithm also builds the best DNN architecture by optimizing the parameters.
Although the confirmation of the results by laboratory experiments has not occurred, the results allow suggesting that miRNAs profile could be used as biomarkers or targets in targeted therapies.
The Drosophila <mark>fussel</mark> gene is required for bitter gustatory neuron differentiation acting within an <mark>Rpd3</mark> dependent chromatin modifying complex.
Members of the <mark>Ski</mark>/<mark>Sno</mark> protein family are classified as proto-oncogenes and act as negative regulators of the <mark>TGF-ss</mark>/<mark>BMP</mark>-pathways in vertebrates and invertebrates.
A newly identified member of this protein family is <mark>fussel</mark> (<mark>fuss</mark>), the Drosophila homologue of the human functional <mark>Smad suppressing elements</mark> (<mark>fussel-15</mark> and <mark>fussel-18</mark>).
We and others have shown that <mark>Fuss</mark> interacts with <mark>SMAD4</mark> and that overexpression leads to a strong inhibition of <mark>Dpp</mark> signaling.
However, to be able to characterize the endogenous <mark>Fuss</mark> function in Drosophila melanogaster, we have generated a number of state of the art tools including anti-<mark>Fuss</mark> antibodies, specific <mark>fuss</mark>-Gal4 lines and <mark>fuss</mark> mutant fly lines via the CRISPR/Cas9 system.
<mark>Fuss</mark> is a predominantly nuclear, postmitotic protein, mainly expressed in interneurons and <mark>fuss</mark> mutants are fully viable without any obvious developmental phenotype.
To identify potential target genes or cells affected in <mark>fuss</mark> mutants, we conducted targeted DamID experiments in adult flies, which revealed the function of <mark>fuss</mark> in bitter gustatory neurons.
We fully characterized <mark>fuss</mark> expression in the adult proboscis and by using food choice assays we were able to show that <mark>fuss</mark> mutants display defects in detecting bitter compounds.
This correlated with a reduction of gustatory receptor gene expression (<mark>Gr33a</mark>, <mark>Gr66a</mark>, <mark>Gr93a</mark>) providing a molecular link to the behavioral phenotype.
In addition, <mark>Fuss</mark> interacts with <mark>Rpd3</mark>, and downregulation of <mark>rpd3</mark> in gustatory neurons phenocopies the loss of <mark>Fuss</mark> expression.
Surprisingly, there is no colocalization of <mark>Fuss</mark> with phosphorylated <mark>Mad</mark> in the larval central nervous system, excluding a direct involvement of <mark>Fuss</mark> in <mark>Dpp</mark>/<mark>BMP</mark> signaling.
Here we provide a first and exciting link of <mark>Fuss</mark> function in gustatory bitter neurons.
Although gustatory receptors have been well characterized, little is known regarding the differentiation and maturation of gustatory neurons.
This work therefore reveals <mark>Fuss</mark> as a pivotal element for the proper differentiation of bitter gustatory neurons acting within a chromatin modifying complex.
Use of Physcion to Improve Atopic Dermatitis-Like Skin Lesions through Blocking of <mark>Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin</mark>.
Physcion is well known for the treatment of carcinoma.
However, the therapeutic effect of physcion on atopic dermatitis (AD) through the inhibition of <mark>thymic stromal lymphopoietin</mark> (<mark>TSLP</mark>) level remains largely unknown.
In this study, we investigated the anti-AD effect of physcion using HMC-1 cells, splenocytes, and a murine model.
Treatment with physcion decreased production and mRNA expression levels of <mark>TSLP</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>TNF-alpha</mark>, and <mark>IL-1beta</mark> in activated HMC-1 cells.
Physcion reduced the expression levels of <mark>RIP2</mark>/<mark>caspase-1</mark> and phospho (p)<mark>ERK</mark>/p<mark>JNK</mark>/p<mark>p38</mark> in activated HMC-1 cells.
Physcion suppressed the expression levels of p<mark>IKKbeta</mark>/<mark>NF-kappaB</mark>/p<mark>IkB</mark> in activated HMC-1 cells.
Moreover, physcion attenuated the production levels of <mark>TSLP</mark>, <mark>IL-4</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, <mark>TNF</mark>-, and <mark>IFN-gamma</mark> from activated splenocytes.
Oral administration of physcion improved the severity of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene-induced AD-like lesional skin through reducing infiltration of inflammatory cells and mast cells, and the protein and mRNA levels of <mark>TSLP</mark>, <mark>IL-4</mark>, and <mark>IL-6</mark> in the lesional skin tissues.
Physcion attenuated histamine, IgE, <mark>TSLP</mark>, <mark>IL-4</mark>, <mark>IL-6</mark>, and <mark>TNF</mark>- levels in serum.
In addition, physcion inhibited <mark>caspase-1</mark> activation in the lesional skin tissues.
These findings indicate that physcion could ameliorate AD-like skin lesions by inhibiting <mark>TSLP</mark> levels via <mark>caspase-1</mark>/<mark>MAPK</mark>s/<mark>NF-kB</mark> signalings, which would provide experimental evidence of the therapeutic potential of physcion for AD.
<mark>Melatonin receptor</mark> depletion suppressed <mark>hCG</mark>-induced testosterone expression in mouse Leydig cells.
<mark>Melatonin receptors</mark> <mark>MT1</mark> and <mark>MT2</mark> (genes officially named <mark>MTNR1A</mark> and <mark>MTNR1B</mark>, respectively) play crucial roles in melatonin-mediated regulation of circadian rhythms, the immune system, and control of reproduction in seasonally breeding animals.
In this study, immunolocalization assay showed that <mark>MT1</mark> and <mark>MT2</mark> are highly expressed in Leydig cell membrane.
To understand the biological function of <mark>melatonin receptors</mark> in <mark>hCG</mark>-induced testosterone synthesis, we generated <mark>melatonin receptor</mark> knockdown cells using specific siRNA and performed testosterone detection after <mark>hCG</mark> treatment.
We found that knockdown of <mark>melatonin receptors</mark>, especially <mark>MTNR1A</mark>, led to an obvious decrease (&gt; 60%) of testosterone level.
Our further study revealed that knockdown of <mark>melatonin receptors</mark> repressed expression, at both the mRNA level and the protein level, of key <mark>steroidogenic genes</mark>, such as <mark>p450scc</mark>, <mark>p450c17</mark> and <mark>StAR</mark>, which are essential for testosterone synthesis.
<mark>hCG</mark> triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to regulate <mark>steroidogenic genes</mark>' expression and apoptosis.
To further investigate the potential roles of <mark>melatonin receptors</mark> in <mark>hCG</mark>-induced regulation of ER stress and apoptosis, we examined expression of some crucial ER stress markers, including <mark>Grp78</mark>, <mark>Chop</mark>, <mark>ATF4</mark>, <mark>Xbp1</mark>, and <mark>IRE1</mark>.
We found that inhibition of <mark>melatonin receptors</mark> increased <mark>hCG</mark>-induced expression of <mark>Grp78</mark>, <mark>Chop</mark> and <mark>ATF4</mark>, but not <mark>Xbp1</mark> and <mark>IRE1</mark>, suggesting that <mark>hCG</mark> may modulate <mark>IRE1</mark> signaling pathways in a melatonin receptor-dependent manner.
In addition, our further data showed that knockdown of <mark>MTNR1A</mark> and <mark>MTNR1B</mark> promoted <mark>hCG</mark>-induced expression of apoptosis markers, including <mark>p53</mark>, <mark>caspase-3</mark> and <mark>Bcl-2</mark>.
These results suggested that the <mark>melatonin receptors</mark> <mark>MTNR1A</mark> and <mark>MTNR1B</mark> are essential to repress <mark>hCG</mark>-induced ER stress and cell apoptosis.
Our studies demonstrated that the mammalian <mark>melatonin receptors</mark> <mark>MT1</mark> and <mark>MT2</mark> are involved in testosterone synthesis via mediating multiple cell pathways.
